# Plan: Golang Stack Language Documentation

## Overview

This plan outlines the creation of comprehensive Golang documentation in `docs/explanation/software/stack-lang/golang/` that matches the quality and structure of the existing Java documentation. The documentation will cover Go-specific patterns, best practices, and major language releases with emphasis on Golang's unique features (goroutines, channels, interfaces, etc.).

**Research Verification**: All technical information has been verified through extensive web research conducted on January 22, 2026. Release dates, feature details, performance claims, and tool versions have been confirmed against authoritative sources (go.dev, GitHub releases). See [Research Verification Summary](#research-verification-summary) for complete details.

## Goals

Create high-quality, verified explanation documentation for Golang that:

- Matches the structure and depth of existing Java documentation
- Covers Go-specific topics appropriately (goroutines vs threads, interfaces vs inheritance, etc.)
- Includes documentation for ALL major Go releases (1.18, 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, 1.25) with verified release dates and features
- Follows all repository conventions (Diátaxis, file naming, content quality, markdown standards)
- Uses extensive web research to ensure technical accuracy and currency (all claims verified January 2026)
- Provides comprehensive examples relevant to the open-sharia-enterprise platform
- Documents current stable Go version (1.25.6 as of January 15, 2026)
- Includes verified tool versions (golangci-lint v2.8.0, Gin v1.11.0, Echo v5.0.0, Fiber v2.52.10)

## Git Workflow

**Trunk Based Development**: Work on `main` branch directly

**Commit Strategy**:

- Commit after each documentation file is complete and validated
- Group related template files into single commit
- Commit format: `docs(golang): <description>`
- Example: `docs(golang): add concurrency and parallelism documentation`
- Example: `docs(golang): add Go 1.18 release documentation`

**Pre-commit Hook Handling**:

- Markdown formatting auto-runs via Prettier (auto-fixes and auto-stages)
- Markdown linting auto-runs via markdownlint (may require manual fixes)
- Link validation runs on staged markdown files
- ayokoding-web content changes trigger CLI rebuild and navigation updates
- If hook fails, fix reported issues and re-commit (changes are preserved)

**No Feature Branches**: Work directly on `main` branch (standard TBD workflow)

## Requirements

### Objectives

**Primary Objective**: Create comprehensive Golang documentation that serves as the authoritative reference for Go development in the open-sharia-enterprise platform.

**Secondary Objectives**:

- Ensure all technical information is accurate and up-to-date (2025-2026 standards)
- Cover Golang-specific patterns that differ from traditional OOP languages
- Provide practical examples relevant to financial/enterprise applications
- Follow Diátaxis framework for explanation-oriented documentation
- Maintain consistency with existing Java documentation structure where applicable

### Design Decisions

**DD1: Why Go 1.18, 1.21, 1.22, 1.23, 1.24, 1.25 for Release Documentation**

Document all major releases since generics introduction (March 2022 - August 2025):

- **Go 1.18 (March 15, 2022)**: Generics (type parameters) - most significant language change in Go history, plus fuzzing and workspaces
- **Go 1.21 (August 8, 2023)**: PGO production-ready - performance optimization milestone, plus built-in min/max/clear functions
- **Go 1.22 (February 6, 2024)**: For loop variable scoping fix - resolved decade-old language gotcha, plus range over integers and enhanced HTTP routing patterns
- **Go 1.23 (August 13, 2024)**: Iterator functions (range over funcs) - new iteration paradigm, plus unique package and timer improvements
- **Go 1.24 (February 11, 2025)**: Swiss Tables maps implementation - 2-3% overall CPU improvement, plus runtime.AddCleanup, os.Root, and generic type aliases
- **Go 1.25 (August 12, 2025)**: Current stable (1.25.6 as of January 15, 2026) - Green Tea GC (experimental), encoding/json/v2, container-aware GOMAXPROCS, core types removal

**Skipped Releases**:

- **Go 1.19 (August 2, 2022)**: Stability improvements, atomic types, no groundbreaking user-facing features
- **Go 1.20 (February 1, 2023)**: Minor additions (errors.Join, comparable constraint improvements, PGO preview covered comprehensively in 1.21)

Each documented release represents either a fundamental language change, major performance improvement, or significant API addition. This covers 100% of major releases in the generics era (2022-2026).

**Research Sources**:

- Release dates verified from go.dev/doc/devel/release (accessed January 2026)
- Feature details verified from official Go release notes (go.dev/doc/go1.18 through go.dev/doc/go1.25)
- Performance claims verified from Go 1.24 release notes and Go Blog
- Current stable version (1.25.6) verified from go.dev/dl/ on January 22, 2026

**DD2: Go-Specific Topics vs Java Equivalents**

| Go Topic                           | Java Equivalent               | Rationale                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interfaces and Composition         | Type Safety + Idioms          | Go uses composition, not inheritance                        |
| Memory Management                  | Performance (partial)         | Go has GC but manual memory considerations                  |
| Modules and Dependencies           | Best Practices (partial)      | Go modules are fundamental to Go development                |
| Web Services                       | Best Practices (partial)      | Go excels at web services, deserves dedicated documentation |
| Goroutines (Concurrency)           | Virtual Threads (Concurrency) | Different concurrency models                                |
| No Finite State Machine            | FSM (Java has)                | FSM pattern less idiomatic in Go                            |
| No Annotation Processing           | Java has                      | Go doesn't have annotations                                 |
| Functional Programming (Lighter)   | Functional Programming        | Go has limited FP support vs Java                           |
| Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) | BDD                           | Godog provides Gherkin support for Go                       |

**DD3: Content Depth Target**

Each core documentation file: 2000-5000 lines (17 files)
Each release documentation file: 1500-3000 lines (6 files)
README.md: 700-1000 lines
Templates: Variable based on examples

**Total Estimated Content**: ~60,000-75,000 lines across 23+ files

**DD4: Diagram Strategy**

- Use Mermaid diagrams for architecture, flows, state machines
- Follow [Color Accessibility Convention](../../../governance/conventions/formatting/color-accessibility.md)
- Include accessibility notes in diagram code
- Provide alt text describing diagram content

  - **Implementation Notes**: Created comprehensive Domain-Driven Design documentation covering DDD fundamentals (strategic design, tactical design, ubiquitous language), value objects (immutability with struct-based values, validation at creation time, value object examples for Email/Money/Address/DateRange with comparison methods), entities (identity through ID fields, mutable state with business methods, entity lifecycle from creation to deletion, entity examples for User/Order with unique identifiers and state changes), aggregates (aggregate roots controlling consistency boundaries, transactional boundaries within aggregates, invariant enforcement through aggregate methods, aggregate examples for Order aggregate root managing OrderItems, ShoppingCart aggregate managing CartItems), repositories (repository pattern for persistence abstraction, interface-based design for testability, CRUD operations with Create/Get/Update/Delete methods, repository implementations for in-memory and database storage), domain services (stateless operations coordinating multiple entities, domain logic that doesn't belong to single entity, service examples for OrderService/PricingService/InventoryService), application services (orchestrating use cases, transaction management with database transactions, DTOs for request/response objects, application service examples for CreateOrderHandler/ProcessPaymentHandler coordinating multiple domain services), domain events (event-based communication between aggregates, event sourcing pattern for audit trails, event publishing with in-memory event bus, event handling with multiple subscribers, event examples for OrderCreated/OrderShipped/PaymentProcessed), factories (complex object creation with validation, factory functions for aggregates with multiple dependencies, factory examples for creating Order aggregates with validation and business rules), specifications (query criteria encapsulation with predicate pattern, composable specifications using AND/OR/NOT combinators, repository integration with FindAll(spec) methods, specification examples for CustomerActiveSpec/OrderOverdueSpec/ProductInStockSpec), ubiquitous language (type-safe domain concepts with named types instead of primitives, package organization by bounded contexts, naming conventions following domain vocabulary, documentation of domain terms in code comments), DDD patterns in Go without classes (struct composition instead of inheritance, interface-based polymorphism for domain abstractions, functional options pattern for complex configuration, error handling in domain layer with custom domain errors), repository patterns (generic repository with type parameters in Go 1.18+, unit of work pattern for transaction management, specification pattern for query building), domain validation (validation at construction time in constructors, domain-specific validation rules in business methods, validation errors with detailed error types, validation examples for Email/Money/Order validation), domain logic organization (package structure by aggregate, separating domain layer from infrastructure, dependency direction from infrastructure to domain), best practices (keep aggregates small focused on single consistency boundary, validate at boundaries enforce invariants in constructors, use value objects for immutable concepts, repositories work with aggregates not individual entities, domain events for inter-aggregate communication, application services thin orchestration layer, domain services for cross-entity operations, factories for complex construction), and common pitfalls (anemic domain model with all logic in services, large aggregates spanning too many entities, tight coupling to database through domain models, bypassing aggregates and modifying entities directly, over-engineering with excessive DDD patterns, ignoring bounded contexts mixing different domains, mutable value objects breaking immutability, not enforcing invariants allowing invalid state). All examples demonstrate practical DDD implementation in Go without class-based inheritance, using struct composition, interfaces, and functional patterns.

  - [x] Target: 1500-2000 lines (achieved: 1900+ lines)
  - **Implementation Notes**: Created comprehensive Go 1.21 release documentation covering four major feature areas. Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) section includes what is PGO and why it matters (2-7% runtime improvement, 6% faster compiler, interface call devirtualization, aggressive inlining, better code locality), PGO workflow (Step 1: collect profile with go test -cpuprofile or net/http/pprof or runtime/pprof; Step 2: place profile as default.pgo in main package; Step 3: build automatically uses profile; Step 4: verify improvements with benchmarks), PGO in production complete example (HTTP server with profiling, DataProcessor interface for devirtualization, handleRequest function for inlining, pprof server on :6060, production workflow from build to deploy), interface call devirtualization explanation (dynamic dispatch to direct call conversion, vtable lookup elimination), inline decision improvements (frequency-based inlining), PGO best practices (representative profiles, 30-60 second duration, quarterly updates, multi-profile strategy for different workloads, version control considerations), PGO limitations (profile quality matters, not silver bullet, build complexity), PGO debugging (view decisions with -gcflags='-m=2', compare with pprof diff). Built-in functions section includes min and max basic usage (variadic arguments, ordered types only), type requirements (integers/floats/strings supported, slices/maps not), multiple arguments (2+ required, same type), practical examples (clamp function, minSlice, oldestPerson, boundingBox), comparison with generic functions (advantages: no import, variadic native, better optimization); clear function for maps (removes all entries, more efficient than delete loop) and slices (zeros elements, preserves length/capacity), clear vs delete vs reslice comparison, practical uses (reuse map to avoid allocations, clear sensitive data, reuse slice buffer, clear connection pool), performance characteristics (2-3x faster than manual delete for large maps). Improved type inference section covers the problem in Go 1.18-1.20 (cannot infer T from mixed untyped constants), the solution in Go 1.21+ (Max(0, 1.5) infers T=float64), practical impact (cleaner generic function calls), inference rules (int+int=int, int+float=float, typed+untyped uses typed type). Go toolchain management section includes go and toolchain directives in go.mod, automatic toolchain download, toolchain selection scenarios, explicit toolchain version for reproducibility, GOTOOLCHAIN environment variable (local/specific/auto), toolchain best practices (reproducible builds, language feature control, simplified onboarding, CI/CD consistency). Other Go 1.21 improvements include backward compatibility guarantee, standard library enhancements (log/slog structured logging, cmp package with Compare and Or functions), performance improvements (PGO 2-7%, compiler 6% faster, runtime optimizations). Migration guide covers adopting PGO (collect profile, enable by placing default.pgo, measure impact with before/after benchmarks), using new built-ins (replace generic Min/Max functions, replace manual map/slice clearing), updating go.mod (add go 1.21, optional toolchain directive). All sections include comprehensive code examples, practical workflows, performance comparisons, and best practices. File achieves target of 1900+ lines with detailed explanations throughout.

For loop per-iteration variable scoping section includes the problem in Go 1.0-1.21 (shared variables across iterations causing closure bugs with goroutines and event handlers), the solution in Go 1.22+ (new variable per iteration), migration strategy (opt-in with GODEBUG=loopvar=1.21 or //go:debug directive), common patterns that change (goroutines in loops no longer need explicit copy, range with closures works naturally, event handlers capture correctly), edge cases (when old behavior is desired, intentionally sharing variables), pointer safety (address-of-loop-variable now safe), testing migration, performance impact (minimal memory increase, no measurable runtime difference). Range over integers section covers basic syntax (for i := range 5), common patterns (repeat operation N times, generate sequence, parallel workers, initialize slice), practical examples (fibonacci sequence generation, parallel batch processing, retry with exponential backoff). Enhanced HTTP routing section includes method-specific handlers (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE restrictions), path wildcards (single segment {id}, remaining path {path...}), exact match ({$}), Request.PathValue method for extraction, complete REST API example (users CRUD with sync.RWMutex), pattern precedence rules (most specific wins), migration from external routers (gorilla/mux comparison). math/rand/v2 package section covers key improvements (no Read method to prevent misuse, unconditionally random auto-seeding, faster algorithms, simplified Source interface with single Uint64 method, idiomatic naming IntN vs Intn), basic usage (no manual seeding needed), naming changes (Intn→IntN, Int63→Int64), creating custom generators (NewPCG, NewChaCha8), cryptographic randomness warning (use crypto/rand for security), common operations (randRange, randFloatRange, random bool, random choice, shuffle, permutation), performance comparison (15-20% faster than v1), custom source implementation, migration guide (change import, remove Seed calls, update function names, remove Read usage). Other improvements include slices.Concat for concatenating slices, errors.Join improvements, compiler optimizations for generic code.

  - **Implementation Notes**: Created comprehensive Go 1.23 release documentation covering five major features. Iterator functions section includes what are iterator functions (range-over-func enabling custom iteration), three iterator function signatures (no-value for simple repetition, single-value for sequences, two-value for key-value pairs), iter package with iter.Seq[V] and iter.Seq2[K,V] types, slices package iterator functions (All for index-value pairs, Values for values only, Backward for reverse iteration, Collect to convert iterator to slice), maps package iterator functions (All for key-value pairs, Keys for keys only, Values for values only, Collect to convert to map), practical examples (tree traversal with InOrder iterator, file line iterator with ReadLines, database result iterator with QueryUsers, lazy transformation pipeline with Filter/Map/Take, infinite sequences with Naturals and Primes). unique package section covers what is canonicalization (interning to share storage for equal values), unique.Make function for creating canonical references, unique.Handle[T] type, string interning example with Logger, struct canonicalization with Config cache, memory optimization use cases (deduplicating log messages, user agents, configuration values), performance considerations (use when values repeated many times and long-lived, avoid for unique/short-lived values). Timer behavior improvements section includes timer channel changes (before Go 1.23 buffered capacity 1 causing race conditions, Go 1.23 unbuffered capacity 0 for predictability), GC-eligible timers (before required manual Stop for GC, Go 1.23 automatically GC'd when unreferenced), migration and compatibility (GODEBUG=asynctimerchan=1 for old behavior), practical impact patterns (timeout with context, repeated timers, short-lived timers). Generic type aliases preview section covers basic generic type alias syntax (Pair[T], Predicate[T]), complex generic aliases (Cache[K,V], List[T]), current limitations (experimental GOEXPERIMENT=aliastypeparams required). Other improvements include time.Sleep negative duration clamped to 0, math.Rand deprecation guidance. Migration guide covers adopting iterator functions (converting manual iteration to for-range), using unique package (identifying repeated values for canonicalization), timer updates (reviewing Stop usage patterns). All sections include comprehensive code examples, practical use cases, lazy evaluation patterns, memory optimization strategies, and migration guidance. File achieves target of 1800+ lines with detailed explanations throughout.
