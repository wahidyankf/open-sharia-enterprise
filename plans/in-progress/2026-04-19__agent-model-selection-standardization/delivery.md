# Delivery Checklist

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Run `npm install` to install workspace dependencies
- [ ] Run `npm run doctor -- --fix` to converge the Go and Node toolchains (required before
      any `validate:*` or `sync:*` script can invoke the rhino-cli binary)
- [x] Running directly on `main` branch (no worktree — governance-only changes, no code)
- [x] Confirm `npm run validate:claude` passes on clean branch (baseline) _(verified 2026-04-19)_
- [x] Confirm `npm run validate:sync` passes on clean branch (baseline) _(verified 2026-04-19)_

### Commit Guidelines

- Commit changes thematically — group related changes into logically cohesive commits
- Follow Conventional Commits format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
- Split different domains/concerns into separate commits
- Do NOT bundle unrelated fixes into a single commit
- Example: separate `docs(model-selection): ...` from `fix(agents): ...` commits

---

---

## Phase 4: Create Model Benchmark Reference Document

Create `docs/reference/ai-model-benchmarks.md` — the project's canonical benchmark
reference. All subsequent files that cite benchmark numbers link to this document. This
document links to primary sources. Structure and content are fully specified in
`tech-docs.md` under "Benchmark Reference Document Specification".

- [ ] **4.1** Create `docs/reference/ai-model-benchmarks.md` following the spec in
      `tech-docs.md § Benchmark Reference Document Specification`
- [ ] **4.2** Verify every benchmark number has: source URL, publication date, confidence
      level (`[Verified]` / `[Self-reported]` / `[Needs Verification]`)
- [ ] **4.3** Verify the GLM-5-turbo section prominently flags that no standard benchmarks
      are published for this model
- [ ] **4.4** Verify the model capability summary table is present
- [ ] **4.5** Run `npm run lint:md` — confirm zero errors on new file
- [ ] **4.6** Commit: `docs(reference): add ai-model-benchmarks reference with cited scores`

---

## Phase 5: Agent Tier Audit — Right-Size All 70 Agents

Apply the definitive tier mapping from `tech-docs.md § Complete Agent Tier Mapping`.
**Do not re-reason the mapping** — the table is the authoritative decision, based on
benchmark data and the model-selection.md decision tree. The mapping was verified against
all 70 agent descriptions.

**8 agents change tier** (from `tech-docs.md § Agents Changing Tier`):

| Agent                                   | Change       | Reason                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps-ayokoding-web-by-example-maker`   | OMIT→SONNET  | Tight rubric (density 1.0-2.25, 75-85 count, five-part structure) |
| `apps-ayokoding-web-general-maker`      | OMIT→SONNET  | Template-pattern bilingual content                                |
| `apps-ayokoding-web-in-the-field-maker` | OMIT→SONNET  | Defined rubric (library-first, 20-40 guides)                      |
| `repo-rules-maker`                      | OMIT→SONNET  | Layer hierarchy templates drive output, not open creativity       |
| `repo-ose-primer-adoption-maker`        | OMIT→SONNET  | Classifier table drives all decisions                             |
| `repo-ose-primer-propagation-maker`     | OMIT→SONNET  | Classifier-driven transform; no open design                       |
| `swe-hugo-dev`                          | OMIT→SONNET  | DEPRECATED — no code to generate                                  |
| `apps-ayokoding-web-link-fixer`         | SONNET→HAIKU | Deterministic URL replacement, no reasoning                       |

**Result**: opus-inherit 21→14 (−7), sonnet 42→48 (+6), haiku 7→8 (+1), total 70 unchanged.

- [ ] **5.1** For each of the 8 agents in the change table above:
  - Update `model:` frontmatter field to the new value
  - Update Model Selection Justification block text to match new tier and cite the
    benchmark comparison from `docs/reference/ai-model-benchmarks.md` where relevant
  - Do NOT change color, tools, or any other frontmatter field
- [ ] **5.2** Verify all 62 unchanged agents — spot-check 5 random ones to confirm their
      Model Selection Justification blocks are present and consistent with their tier
- [ ] **5.3** Run `npm run validate:claude` — expect zero errors
- [ ] **5.4** Commit: `fix(agents): right-size model tiers — 7 OMIT→SONNET, 1 SONNET→HAIKU`

---

## Phase 6: Propagate Benchmark Citations via repo-rules-maker

Add benchmark citations (with links to `docs/reference/ai-model-benchmarks.md`) to all
policy docs that make tier-based claims. Use `repo-rules-maker` to identify and update
all affected governance files.

- [ ] **6.1** Invoke `repo-rules-maker` to update `governance/development/agents/model-selection.md`:
  - In the Tier Comparison Summary table, add benchmark score column citing the reference doc
  - In "Current Model Versions", add inline links to the reference doc for each score
  - In the OpenCode / GLM Equivalents section, add caveat about GLM-5-turbo having no
    standard benchmarks (link to reference doc)
- [ ] **6.2** Invoke `repo-rules-maker` to update `.claude/agents/README.md`:
  - Add a "Model Benchmark Context" note (2-3 lines) pointing to the reference doc for
    anyone who wants to understand WHY each tier was chosen
- [ ] **6.3** Verify every benchmark number cited in `model-selection.md` has a link to
      `docs/reference/ai-model-benchmarks.md` with the anchor for the relevant model
- [ ] **6.4** Commit: `docs(governance): add benchmark citations to model-selection + agents README`

---

## Phase 7: repo-rules-checker OCD Validation

Run `repo-rules-checker` in OCD mode after all changes (Phases 4-6).

- [ ] **7.1** Invoke `repo-rules-checker` with `strictness: ocd`
- [ ] **7.2** Review findings — fix all CRITICAL, HIGH, and MEDIUM findings
- [ ] **7.3** Re-run until two consecutive zero-finding passes (per quality gate workflow)
- [ ] **7.4** Commit any fixes: `fix(governance): repo-rules-checker ocd findings`

---

## Phase 8: Validation

- [ ] **8.1** Run `npm run validate:claude` — expect zero errors
- [ ] **8.2** Run `npm run validate:sync` — expect zero errors
- [ ] **8.3** Run `nx run rhino-cli:test:quick` — expect pass

---

## Phase 9: Sync + Final Gate

- [ ] **9.1** Run `npm run sync:dry-run` — agents with updated tiers should show
      OpenCode model ID changes (glm-5.1 for all sonnet/omit-to-sonnet; glm-5-turbo for
      new haiku agents)
- [ ] **9.2** Run `npm run sync:claude-to-opencode` — apply sync
- [ ] **9.3** Run `npm run validate:sync` — final pass

### Local Quality Gates (Before Push)

- [ ] Run `npm run lint:md` — lint all markdown files
- [ ] Run `npm run lint:md:fix` — auto-fix any violations
- [ ] Run `nx affected -t typecheck lint test:quick spec-coverage` — the agent file changes
      trigger rhino-cli as affected; all targets must pass
- [ ] Fix ALL failures found — including preexisting issues not caused by your changes

> **Important**: Fix ALL failures, not just those caused by your changes. Root cause
> orientation: proactively fix preexisting errors encountered during work.

- [ ] **9.4** Push directly to `origin/main`

### Post-Push Verification

- [ ] Monitor the `pr-quality-gate` and `on-push` GitHub Actions workflows for the push
      to `main` — verify all checks pass
- [ ] If any CI check fails, fix immediately and push a follow-up commit
- [ ] Do NOT proceed to archival until CI is green

### Plan Archival

- [ ] **9.5a** Verify ALL delivery checklist items are ticked
- [ ] **9.5b** Verify ALL quality gates pass (local + CI)
- [ ] **9.5c** `git mv plans/in-progress/2026-04-19__agent-model-selection-standardization/ plans/done/`
- [ ] **9.5d** Update `plans/in-progress/README.md` — remove this plan entry
- [ ] **9.5e** Update `plans/done/README.md` — add this plan entry with completion date
- [ ] **9.5f** Commit: `chore(plans): move agent-model-selection-standardization to done`
