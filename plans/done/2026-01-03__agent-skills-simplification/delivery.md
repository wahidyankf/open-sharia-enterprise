# Delivery Plan

## Overview

### Delivery Type

**Trunk Based Development** - All changes committed directly to main branch through comprehensive audit and iterative fixes (no PR workflow)

### Git Workflow

**Trunk Based Development** - All work on main branch, small frequent commits, validation checkpoints between phases

### Summary

This plan delivers agent simplification through three sequential phases based on completed background research: Pilot (validate approach on one family), Rollout (apply to remaining agents), and Verification (final quality gates).

## Background Research (Completed 2026-01-03)

### Agent-Skill Duplication Audit

**Analysis Scope**: 45 agents × 17 Skills (765 comparisons)

**Executive Summary**: Massive duplication detected - 50-80 instances with **6,000-8,000 lines reduction potential** (30-40% of duplicated content).

**Breakdown by Category**:

- Verbatim: 20-25 instances (30-40%)
- Paraphrased: 25-35 instances (40-50%)
- Conceptual: 10-20 instances (15-25%)

**Breakdown by Severity**:

- CRITICAL: 15-20 instances (~25%)
- HIGH: 25-30 instances (~40%)
- MEDIUM: 15-25 instances (~30%)
- LOW: 5-10 instances (~5%)

**Top 5 Duplication Patterns**:

1. **Criticality levels system** (CRITICAL) - 25+ agents, 2,800-4,200 lines total
2. **Hugo ayokoding-web weight system** (CRITICAL) - 3-4 agents, ~400 lines
3. **Annotation density standards** (CRITICAL) - 2 agents, ~150 lines
4. **Maker-Checker-Fixer workflow** (HIGH) - Multiple agents, ~150 lines
5. **Accessible color palette** (HIGH) - 8+ agents, ~80 lines

**Top 5 Agents by Duplication**:

1. apps**ayokoding-web**by-example-maker (~800 lines)
2. apps**ayokoding-web**general-checker (~400 lines)
3. docs\_\_checker (~300 lines)
4. apps**ayokoding-web**structure-maker (~300 lines)
5. apps**ayokoding-web**by-example-checker (~300 lines)

**Most-Duplicated Skills**:

1. assessing-criticality-confidence (25+ agents - all checkers/fixers)
2. developing-ayokoding-content (8-10 ayokoding-web agents)
3. creating-by-example-tutorials (3-4 by-example agents)
4. applying-content-quality (10+ content-creating agents)
5. creating-accessible-diagrams (8+ diagram-using agents)

**Simplification Priority**:

- **P0 (CRITICAL)**: Refactor checker/fixer agents (criticality systems), ayokoding-web agents (weight systems, annotation standards)
- **P1 (HIGH)**: Refactor diagram references, plan agents, README agents
- **P2 (MEDIUM)**: Update agent frontmatter `skills:` fields, create Skill references index

1. **Temporary report file generation** - 12+ checker agents, ~1,000 lines
   - Recommendation: Create Skill `generating-checker-reports`
2. **Criticality level assessment/reporting** - 15+ agents, ~600 lines
   - Recommendation: Extend Skill `assessing-criticality-confidence`

**High-Priority Gaps** (5-9 agents): 3. **Frontmatter validation** - 6 agents, ~590 lines → Create `validating-frontmatter` 4. **Hugo content validation** - 3 agents, ~850 lines → Create `validating-hugo-content` or extend `developing-ayokoding-content` 5. **Diagram splitting/mobile-friendliness** - 5+ agents, ~400 lines → Extend `creating-accessible-diagrams` 6. **Code annotation density validation** - 5+ agents, ~400 lines → Extend `creating-by-example-tutorials` 7. **Nested code fence validation** - 3 agents, ~150 lines → Create `validating-nested-code-fences`

**Medium-Priority Gaps** (3-4 agents):
8-12. Rule reference formatting (~210 lines), mathematical notation (~160 lines), bullet indentation (~95 lines), UUID chain generation (covered by Gap 1), index/intro content (~750 lines)

**New Skills Needed** (4-7 total):

- **Must create**: generating-checker-reports, validating-frontmatter, validating-hugo-content, validating-nested-code-fences
- **Should create**: validating-rule-references, validating-mathematical-notation

**Skills Requiring Extension** (4-5 total):

- assessing-criticality-confidence (emoji indicators, domain examples)
- creating-accessible-diagrams (diagram splitting guidance)
- creating-by-example-tutorials (density measurement methodology)
- applying-content-quality (bullet indentation validation)
- developing-ayokoding-content (Hugo validation or index/intro rules)

**Combined Impact**: Background research identifies **11,600+ lines reduction potential** (6,000-8,000 from duplication elimination + 5,600 from gap remediation).

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- **Background Research Completed**: Audit and gap analysis completed 2026-01-03 (preparatory work)
- **Phase 1 depends on Background Research**: Pilot simplification uses audit findings and gap analysis results
- **Phase 2 depends on Phase 1**: Rollout requires pilot validation (go decision) before proceeding
- **Phase 3 depends on Phase 2**: Final verification requires all agents simplified

### External Dependencies

- **Existing Skills infrastructure**: 17 Skills must be in place and functional
- **Quality gates**: wow**rules**quality-gate workflow must be operational
- **Agent families**: Agent family groupings (maker-checker-fixer) must be defined

### Critical Path

```
Background Research → Phase 1 (Pilot) → Go/No-Go Decision
                                        ↓
                       Phase 2 (Rollout) → Phase 3 (Verification)
```

**Critical Path**: All execution phases are on critical path (sequential dependencies)

**Validation Checkpoints**:

- After Phase 1: Go/No-Go decision for rollout (pilot must demonstrate success)
- After Phase 2: Verify all agents simplified (before final verification)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Large Skill Gaps Discovered

**Description**: Phase 2 gap analysis reveals significant uncovered knowledge, requiring many new Skills

**Impact**: HIGH - Could delay plan significantly or reduce simplification benefits

**Probability**: LOW - Current 17 Skills are comprehensive

**Mitigation**:

- Prioritize critical gaps only (block simplification)
- Accept important gaps (reduce simplification scope for some agents)
- Document minor gaps for future work (don't block plan)
- If critical gaps are extensive, consider creating Skills iteratively during rollout

### Risk 2: Pilot Validation Fails

**Description**: Phase 3 pilot shows regressions in validation/fix accuracy after simplification

**Impact**: CRITICAL - Would require approach redesign or plan abandonment

**Probability**: LOW - Skills provide same knowledge as embedded content

**Mitigation**:

- Pilot selection carefully (docs family is well-understood)
- Conservative pilot simplification (only remove clear duplication)
- Thorough validation testing (comprehensive test cases)
- If pilot fails: Analyze root cause, adjust approach, re-pilot
- No-go decision triggers plan revision (not abandonment)

### Risk 3: Simplification Reduces Agent Clarity

**Description**: Removing embedded explanations makes agents harder to understand (less self-contained)

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Could reduce maintainability despite duplication elimination

**Probability**: MEDIUM - Trade-off between conciseness and self-documentation

**Mitigation**:

- Retain task-specific context in agents (only remove reusable knowledge)
- Add clear Skill references with brief context ("See Skill X for Y details")
- Documentation update includes guidance on writing focused agents
- Pilot phase tests agent clarity (readability review)

### Risk 4: Context Compaction During Audit

**Description**: Phase 1 comprehensive audit exceeds context limits, risking data loss

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Could lose audit findings if not written progressively

**Probability**: LOW - Progressive writing prevents data loss

**Mitigation**:

- Implement progressive report writing (write findings as discovered)
- Initialize report file at audit start
- Write incrementally throughout audit (not buffer and write at end)
- Aligns with Temporary Files Convention requirement for checker agents

### Risk 5: Duplication Creeps Back Over Time

**Description**: Future agent updates re-introduce duplication (developers embed Skill content)

**Impact**: MEDIUM - Reduces long-term benefits of simplification

**Probability**: MEDIUM - Without vigilance, duplication returns

**Mitigation**:

- Document agent-Skill separation patterns clearly (AI Agents Convention)
- Include examples of good separation (what belongs where)
- Add duplication detection to wow\_\_rules-checker (automated checks)
- Consider CI/CD integration for ongoing duplication prevention
- Regular audits (monthly or quarterly) to catch duplication early
