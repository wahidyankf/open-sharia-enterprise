## Instructions

**Quick Idea Capture**: For 1-3 liner ideas not ready for formal planning, use `../ideas.md`.

When archiving a plan:

1. Rename the plan folder to update date prefix to current date (completion date)
2. Move the renamed folder from `in-progress/` to `done/`
3. Update the plan's README.md status to "Done"
4. Add the plan to this list
