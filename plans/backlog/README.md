# Backlog Plans

Planned projects for future implementation.

## Planned Projects

**No active plans in backlog**. All planned projects are either completed or no longer relevant.

## Instructions

**Quick Idea Capture**: For 1-3 liner ideas not ready for formal planning, use `../ideas.md`.

When creating a new plan:

1. Create folder: `YYYY-MM-DD__[project-identifier]/`
2. Add standard files: README.md, requirements.md, tech-docs.md, delivery.md
3. Add the plan to this list
