# Structure Conventions

Documentation organization frameworks, file naming, and project planning structure. These conventions answer the question: **"How do I ORGANIZE documentation?"**

## Purpose

This directory contains standards for how documentation is organized, named, and structured across the repository. These conventions establish the foundational frameworks that govern documentation architecture.

## Documents

- [Diataxis Framework](./diataxis-framework.md) - Understanding the four-category documentation organization framework we use (Tutorials, How-To, Reference, Explanation). Foundational framework for all documentation structure
- [File Naming Convention](./file-naming.md) - Systematic approach to naming files with hierarchical prefixes encoding directory structure. Applies to docs/, governance/, and plans/ directories
- [Plans Organization](./plans.md) - Standards for organizing project planning documents in plans/ folder including structure (ideas.md, backlog/, in-progress/, done/), naming patterns (YYYY-MM-DD\_\_identifier/), lifecycle stages, and project identifiers
- [Programming Language Documentation Separation](./programming-language-docs-separation.md) - Establishes clear separation between repository-specific programming language style guides (docs/explanation/) and educational content (ayokoding-web). Defines scope boundaries, prerequisite requirements, cross-referencing patterns, and DRY principle application

## Key Concepts

### Diataxis Categories

| Category    | Purpose              | User Need            |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Tutorials   | Learning-oriented    | "Help me learn"      |
| How-To      | Problem-solving      | "Help me do X"       |
| Reference   | Information-oriented | "Give me the facts"  |
| Explanation | Understanding        | "Help me understand" |

### File Naming Pattern

```
[prefix]__[content-identifier].md
```

Where prefix encodes the directory path (e.g., `tu__` for tutorials, `hoto__` for how-to).

### Plans Lifecycle

```
ideas.md → backlog/ → in-progress/ → done/
```

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This set of conventions implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[Documentation First](../../principles/content/documentation-first.md)**: The Diataxis Framework establishes a systematic four-category documentation structure, making documentation a primary deliverable rather than an afterthought. Plans Organization convention ensures planning work is documented in structured, discoverable locations.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: File Naming Convention encodes directory structure directly into filenames through hierarchical prefixes, making file location and category explicit without requiring navigation. Plans naming patterns (`YYYY-MM-DD__identifier/`) make lifecycle stage and date explicit in folder names.

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: The four Diataxis categories provide a complete, minimal taxonomy that covers all documentation types without overlap or excessive granularity. File naming uses a simple, consistent prefix pattern rather than complex metadata systems.
