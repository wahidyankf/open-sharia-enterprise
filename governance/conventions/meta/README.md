# Meta Conventions

Documentation organization frameworks and foundational file organization concepts.

## Purpose

These conventions define **HOW documentation should be organized** at the structural level, covering the Diátaxis framework (four-category documentation organization) and systematic file naming approaches. These are the foundational organizational concepts that shape all other conventions.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Documentation organization frameworks
- File and folder naming systems
- Structural organization principles
- Meta-level documentation concepts

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Specific content writing rules (that's content/)
- Markdown formatting syntax (that's formatting/)
- Domain-specific conventions (hugo/, tutorial/)

## Conventions

- [Diátaxis Framework](./diataxis-framework.md) - Four-category documentation organization framework (Tutorials, How-To, Reference, Explanation)
- [File Naming Convention](./file-naming.md) - Systematic approach to naming files with hierarchical prefixes encoding directory structure

## Related Documentation

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This set of conventions implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: File Naming Convention encodes directory structure in filename prefixes, making file locations explicit without requiring inspection of file contents.

- **[Progressive Disclosure](../../principles/content/progressive-disclosure.md)**: Diátaxis Framework organizes documentation into four distinct categories (Tutorials, How-To, Reference, Explanation), allowing users to access appropriate content based on their current needs.

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: Meta conventions use simple, systematic organization frameworks rather than complex taxonomies or hierarchies.
