# Linking Conventions

This category contains standards for cross-referencing and internal linking in markdown documentation.

## Purpose

Linking conventions ensure consistent, maintainable internal references across the repository. These standards govern how markdown files reference other files, ensuring links remain functional and follow repository conventions.

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

### [Internal AyoKoding References](./internal-ayokoding-references.md)

Standards for linking between AyoKoding educational content and OSE Platform documentation, including language prefix requirements, absolute path conventions, and cross-repository reference patterns.

## Related Conventions

- [File Naming Convention](../structure/file-naming.md) - Correct file names enable accurate linking
- [Diátaxis Framework](../structure/diataxis-framework.md) - Documentation organization affects link paths
- [Hugo Linking Conventions](../hugo/README.md) - Hugo-specific linking patterns

## Principles Implemented/Respected

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: Direct markdown links, no complex indirection
- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Links are explicit paths, not computed references
- **[Documentation First](../../principles/content/documentation-first.md)**: Clear linking standards prevent broken references
