# Tutorial Conventions

Tutorial creation, structure, naming, and content standards for educational content.

## Purpose

These conventions define **HOW to create and structure tutorials**, covering tutorial types, depth levels, naming standards, programming language content architecture, and by-example tutorial formats. These standards ensure consistent, high-quality learning experiences.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Tutorial structure and organization
- Tutorial naming and depth levels
- Programming language education architecture
- By-example tutorial standards
- Tutorial quality requirements

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- General content quality (that's content/)
- Markdown formatting (that's formatting/)
- Hugo-specific content rules (that's hugo/)

## Conventions

- [By Example Tutorial](./by-example.md) - Standards for code-first by-example tutorials with 75-90 heavily annotated examples achieving 95% coverage
- [General Tutorial Convention](./general.md) - Standards for creating learning-oriented tutorials with narrative flow and progressive scaffolding
- [Programming Language Content Standard](./programming-language-content.md) - Universal content architecture for programming language education on ayokoding-web
- [Programming Language Tutorial Structure](./programming-language-structure.md) - Dual-path tutorial organization (by-concept and by-example) for programming languages
- [Tutorial Naming](./naming.md) - Standardized tutorial types and depth levels (Initial Setup, Quick Start, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Cookbook)

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This set of conventions implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[No Time Estimates](../../principles/content/no-time-estimates.md)**: Tutorial conventions use coverage percentages and depth levels rather than time estimates, focusing on learning outcomes rather than duration.

- **[Progressive Disclosure](../../principles/content/progressive-disclosure.md)**: Tutorial naming conventions and depth levels (Initial Setup, Quick Start, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Cookbook) enable progressive learning based on user's current knowledge level.

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: By-example tutorial approach provides code-first learning with simple, annotated examples rather than complex theoretical explanations.
