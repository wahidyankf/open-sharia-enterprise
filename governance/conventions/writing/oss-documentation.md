# OSS Documentation Convention

Standards for creating and maintaining repository-level documentation files that follow open source best practices. This convention defines requirements for README, CONTRIBUTING.md, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), security documentation, and other repository-level files.

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This convention implements the following core principles:

- **[Accessibility First](../../principles/content/accessibility-first.md)**: README quality standards require clear, scannable content accessible to diverse audiences (non-native English speakers, screen reader users, developers of all skill levels).

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Architecture Decision Records document the "why" behind decisions explicitly. No hidden assumptions or implicit knowledge - reasoning is stated clearly for future maintainers.

## Purpose

This convention defines documentation standards specific to open-source software projects. It establishes requirements for README files, CONTRIBUTING guides, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY policies, and LICENSE files that make open-source projects welcoming and professional.

## Scope

### What This Convention Covers

- **Essential OSS files** - README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY
- **File content requirements** - What each OSS file must contain
- **Community guidelines** - How to write contributor-friendly documentation
- **Legal compliance** - License and attribution requirements
- **Project metadata** - Badges, status indicators, project health signals

### What This Convention Does NOT Cover

- **Application documentation** - Product docs covered in Diátaxis framework categories
- **Internal documentation** - Internal practices covered in development conventions
- **API documentation** - Technical reference covered in reference/ category
- **Deployment documentation** - Covered in how-to guides

## Overview

Repository documentation serves as the primary interface between the project and its users, contributors, and maintainers. Well-structured documentation:

1. **Reduces Onboarding Time** - New contributors can quickly understand the project and start contributing
2. **Improves Discoverability** - Clear documentation helps users find and evaluate the project
3. **Enables Collaboration** - Explicit guidelines reduce friction in the contribution process
4. **Documents Decisions** - Architecture Decision Records preserve the reasoning behind key decisions
5. **Builds Trust** - Professional documentation signals project maturity and maintainability

## README Standards

The README is the primary entry point to the project. It should provide enough information for users to evaluate the project and get started quickly.

### Essential Sections

All READMEs must include:

1. **Project Title & Description**
   - Clear, concise project name
   - 1-2 sentence description of what the project does
   - Badges (build status, coverage, version, license)

2. **Motivation & Purpose**
   - Why does this project exist?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - Who is it for?

3. **Quick Start**
   - Installation instructions (copy-paste ready)
   - Minimal example to verify installation
   - Prerequisites clearly stated

4. **Key Features**
   - Bulleted list of main capabilities
   - Focus on user benefits, not implementation details

5. **Usage Examples**
   - Real code examples (not pseudocode)
   - Common use cases
   - Link to detailed documentation

6. **Documentation Links**
   - Link to full documentation
   - Link to API reference
   - Link to tutorials

7. **Contributing**
   - Link to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Brief encouragement to contribute

8. **License**
   - License type (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0)
   - Link to full LICENSE file

### Writing Principles

**Write for Beginners:**

- Explain like you're talking to a friend
- Avoid jargon or explain technical terms
- Assume no prior knowledge of the project
- List specific steps to remove ambiguity

**Keep it Concise:**

- README is an overview, not comprehensive docs
- Link to detailed documentation in `docs/`
- Use progressive disclosure (basics first, advanced later)

**Maintain Freshness:**

- Update README when project changes
- Keep examples working and tested
- Remove outdated information promptly

**Use Visual Hierarchy:**

- Clear section headings
- Bulleted lists for scanability
- Code blocks for commands and examples
- Tables for structured information

### Examples

**Good README structure:**

````markdown

## ️ Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs document significant architectural decisions, preserving the context and reasoning for future maintainers.

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR for **architecturally significant decisions**:

- **Technology Choices** - Selecting frameworks, libraries, databases, cloud providers
- **Architectural Patterns** - Monorepo vs. polyrepo, microservices vs. monolith, state management
- **Infrastructure Decisions** - Deployment strategy, CI/CD approach, monitoring tools
- **Design Patterns** - Authentication approach, caching strategy, API design
- **Trade-offs** - Performance vs. simplicity, flexibility vs. standardization

**Do NOT create ADRs for:**

- Routine implementation details
- Temporary experimental code
- Decisions easily reversed without impact
- Minor library version updates

### ADR Structure

All ADRs must follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Number]. [Short Title]

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Context

What is the issue we're facing? What factors are relevant?
Describe the forces at play (technical, political, social, project).
This section is value-neutral - present facts and constraints.

## Decision

What decision did we make?
State the decision clearly and concisely.
Use active voice: "We will use Nx for monorepo management."

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult because of this decision?
Include both positive and negative consequences.
Be honest about trade-offs.

### Positive Consequences

- Benefit 1
- Benefit 2

### Negative Consequences

- Trade-off 1
- Trade-off 2

### Neutral Consequences

- Other impacts
```

### Storage and Naming

**Location:** `docs/adr/`

**Naming Pattern:** `NNNN-short-title.md`

- `NNNN` = 4-digit sequential number (0001, 0002, etc.)
- `short-title` = Kebab-case descriptive title
- Examples: `0001-use-nx-for-monorepo.md`, `0002-adopt-diataxis-framework.md`

**Index File:** `docs/adr/README.md` lists all ADRs with status

### Lifecycle Management

**Immutability:**

- ADRs are **immutable** after acceptance
- Do not edit the content of accepted ADRs
- If decision changes, create new ADR that supersedes old one

**Status Transitions:**

    style Superseded fill:#CC78BC,stroke:#000,color:#fff
    style Deprecated fill:#CA9161,stroke:#000,color:#fff
```

**Superseding ADRs:**

When decision changes, create new ADR:

1. Create new ADR with status "Proposed"
2. In new ADR context, reference previous ADR: "This supersedes ADR-0001"
3. After approval, update old ADR status: "Superseded by ADR-0005"
4. Do not modify old ADR's decision or consequences sections

### Review Process

**Meeting Format:**

- **Time-box:** 30-45 minutes maximum
- **Readout Style:** 10-15 minutes silent reading, then written feedback
- **Participants:** Cross-functional team, < 10 people
- **Author Ownership:** Author owns document and incorporates feedback

**Approval:**

- Team consensus required
- Document decision in ADR itself (add approval date)
- Update status from "Proposed" to "Accepted"

### Example ADR

```markdown
# 0001. Use Nx for Monorepo Management

Date: 2025-11-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We are building an enterprise platform that will consist of multiple applications (web, mobile, APIs) and shared libraries (utilities, components, domain logic). We need to decide how to organize and build this codebase.

Options considered:

1. **Polyrepo** - Separate repositories for each app and library
2. **Manual Monorepo** - Single repository with custom build scripts
3. **Nx Monorepo** - Single repository with Nx build system
4. **Turborepo** - Single repository with Turborepo build system

Key factors:

- Need to share code between apps (authentication, domain models, UI components)
- Want fast builds (only rebuild what changed)
- TypeScript is primary language
- Small team (< 10 developers initially)
- Need clear dependency management

## Decision

We will use Nx as our monorepo build system.

Rationale:

- Nx provides excellent TypeScript support with automatic project references
- Built-in task caching dramatically speeds up CI/CD
- Dependency graph visualization helps understand system
- Affected detection rebuilds only changed projects
- Strong documentation and community support

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Fast Builds:** Task caching reduces build time from minutes to seconds for unchanged projects
- **Code Sharing:** Easy to share libraries across apps with TypeScript path mappings
- **Dependency Management:** Nx enforces proper dependency boundaries, preventing circular dependencies
- **Developer Experience:** Single `nx` command interface for all projects
- **Scalability:** Architecture supports growth from 5 to 50+ projects

### Negative Consequences

- **Learning Curve:** Team must learn Nx commands and concepts
- **Vendor Lock-in:** Migration away from Nx would require significant effort
- **Configuration Complexity:** Each project needs `project.json` configuration
- **Build Tool Dependency:** Reliant on Nx team for bug fixes and updates

### Neutral Consequences

- **Node.js Ecosystem:** Committed to Node.js/TypeScript ecosystem (not polyglot)
- **Repository Size:** Single repository will grow large over time
```

- Each app/library has its own README
- Link from root README to app/library READMEs

**CONTRIBUTING.md Additions:**

- Explain monorepo structure (`apps/`, `libs/`)
- Document workspace commands (`nx run-many`, `nx affected`)
- Explain dependency boundaries
- Show how to create new apps/libraries

**ADRs:**

- Create ADRs at appropriate scope:
  - Workspace-level decisions in `docs/adr/`
  - App-specific decisions in `apps/[name]/docs/adr/`
  - Library-specific decisions in `libs/[name]/docs/adr/`
