# Programming Language Content Standard

**Defines the universal content architecture for programming language education on ayokoding-web.**

All programming language content on ayokoding-web follows a standardized **Full Set Tutorial Package** architecture: 5 mandatory components (foundational tutorials, by-concept track, by-example track, cookbook, plus supporting documentation) providing complete language education from 0% to 95% coverage through multiple learning modalities.

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This convention implements the following core principles:

- **[Progressive Disclosure](../../principles/content/progressive-disclosure.md)**: Coverage levels (0-5%, 5-30%, 0-60%, 60-85%, 85-95%) implement gradual complexity layering, allowing learners to build knowledge incrementally without overwhelming them with advanced concepts too early.
- **[Accessibility First](../../principles/content/accessibility-first.md)**: Standardized structure aids diverse learners with predictable navigation, color-blind friendly palettes in all diagrams, and WCAG-compliant content formatting.
- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: Flat directory structure with consistent file naming across all languages, avoiding nested hierarchies that add cognitive overhead.
- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Clear coverage percentages define scope boundaries, explicit quality metrics provide objective benchmarks, and documented standards eliminate guesswork.

## Purpose

This convention ensures:

- **Consistency**: Learners encounter familiar structure across all languages
- **Completeness**: Clear definition of what "done" means for a language
- **Quality**: Measurable standards for content depth and pedagogical effectiveness
- **Scalability**: Proven template works across paradigms (procedural, OOP, functional, concurrent)
- **Predictability**: Teams can estimate effort for new language additions

## Scope

This convention applies to:

- **All programming language tutorial content** across the repository:
  - **ayokoding-web** (`apps/ayokoding-web/content/[lang]/learn/swe/programming-languages/[language]/`)
  - **docs/** (`docs/tutorials/software-engineering/programming-languages/[language]/`)
  - **Any other location** where programming language tutorials exist
- Includes: tutorials (foundational, by-concept, by-example, cookbook), how-to guides, best practices, anti-patterns
- Enforced by: `apps-ayokoding-web-general-checker`, `apps-ayokoding-web-by-example-checker`, `apps-ayokoding-web-general-maker`, `apps-ayokoding-web-by-example-maker`, `apps-ayokoding-web-facts-checker` agents

**Implementation Notes**: While the Full Set Tutorial Package architecture applies universally, Hugo-specific implementation details (frontmatter, weight values, navigation) are covered in [Hugo conventions](../hugo/)

## Universal Directory Structure

Every programming language MUST follow this structure:

```
[language]/                                    # Level 5 folder (e.g., /en/learn/swe/programming-languages/golang/)

    └── overview.md                           # Content (weight: 1000000, level 7 - content inside level 6 folder)
```

**Weight System Explanation:**

Programming language folders (e.g., `golang/`, `python/`, `java/`) are at **level 5** in the directory hierarchy:

```
/en/ (level 1) → /learn/ (level 2) → /swe/ (level 3) → /programming-languages/ (level 4) → /golang/ (level 5)
```

**Understanding Levels and Weights:**

The level-based weight system uses a two-part rule:

1. **Folder's `_index.md`** represents the folder itself at level N → uses level N weight
2. **Content INSIDE the folder** is one level deeper → uses level N+1 base weight

**Why This Design?**

- `_index.md` IS the folder (navigation hub) → uses the folder's own level
- Regular content files LIVE INSIDE the folder → one level deeper in hierarchy
- Hugo compares siblings only → weights reset independently per parent

**Detailed Weight Calculation:**

- **Level 5 folder** (`golang/`, `python/`, `java/`):
  - These folders exist at level 5 in the directory tree
  - Each folder's `_index.md` represents the folder at level 5 → **weight: 10002** (level 5 range: 10000-99999)
  - Why 10002? Because golang/ might be the 3rd language among siblings (first is 10000, second is 10001, third is 10002)

- **Level 6 content** (files INSIDE the level 5 language folder):
  - Content inside a level 5 folder is one level deeper → uses **level 6 base: 100000** (level 6 range: 100000-999999)
  - `overview.md`: **100000** (first content file, uses level 6 base)
  - `tutorials/_index.md`: **100002** (represents the tutorials folder at level 6, 3rd sibling among category folders)
  - `how-to/_index.md`: **100003** (represents the how-to folder at level 6, 4th sibling)
  - `explanation/_index.md`: **100004** (represents the explanation folder at level 6, 5th sibling)
  - `reference/_index.md`: **100005** (represents the reference folder at level 6, 6th sibling)

- **Level 7 content** (files INSIDE the level 6 category folders):
  - Content inside level 6 folders is one level deeper → uses **level 7 base: 1000000** (level 7 range: 1000000-9999999)
  - **CRITICAL: Weights RESET per parent** - Each category folder's children independently start at 1000000
  - `tutorials/by-example/`: **1000000** (first folder in tutorials/, Component 3 - PRIORITY)
  - `tutorials/by-concept/`: **1000001** (second folder in tutorials/, Component 4)
  - `tutorials/cookbook/`: **1000002** (third folder in tutorials/, Component 5)
  - `tutorials/initial-setup.md`: **1000003** (fourth item, Component 1)
  - `tutorials/quick-start.md`: **1000004** (fifth item, Component 2)
  - `how-to/overview.md`: **1000000** (RESET - different parent, content inside how-to/ folder)
  - `explanation/overview.md`: **1000000** (RESET - different parent, content inside explanation/ folder)
  - `reference/overview.md`: **1000000** (RESET - different parent, content inside reference/ folder)

**Key Insight: "Level" Has Two Meanings**

1. **Directory depth** (counting from /en/): golang/ is 5 steps from root
2. **Weight range** (powers of 10): level 5 uses 10000-99999, level 6 uses 100000-999999

The rule connects them: folder at directory depth N uses weight range N, content inside uses weight range N+1.

For complete details on the level-based weight system, see [Hugo Content Convention - ayokoding](../hugo/ayokoding.md).

**Notes:**

- File names are FIXED (do not rename `beginner.md` to `basics.md`)
- Reference directory is placeholder for future API documentation
- All directories require `_index.md` and `overview.md`
- Weights follow powers of 10 progression: 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000...

### Cookbook Location Change

**CRITICAL UPDATE (2026-01-30):** Cookbook has **MOVED** from `how-to/cookbook.md` to `tutorials/cookbook/` folder as **Component 5** of the Full Set Tutorial Package.

**Old Location (DEPRECATED):** `how-to/cookbook.md` at position 3 (weight: 1000001)
**New Location:** `tutorials/cookbook/` folder (weight: 1000002)

**Rationale for Move:**

1. **Part of Complete Educational Package**: Cookbook complements both learning tracks (by-concept and by-example)
2. **Used Alongside Tutorials**: Learners reference cookbook while studying tutorials, not as separate how-to guide
3. **Practical Learning Component**: Bridges theory (tutorials) with real-world problem-solving
4. **Consistent Organization**: All tutorial-related content in one location

**Migration Impact**: Languages currently with `how-to/cookbook.md` need migration to `tutorials/cookbook/` folder.

**New Cookbook Structure:**

```
# PASS: GOOD: Cookbook in tutorials/ folder as Component 5
tutorials/
├── _index.md           (100002) ← Level 6 (represents tutorials folder)
├── by-example/         (1000000) ← Level 7 (Component 3 - PRIORITY)
├── by-concept/         (1000001) ← Level 7 (Component 4)
├── cookbook/           (1000002) ← Level 7 (Component 5, NEW LOCATION)
│   ├── _index.md       (1000002) ← Represents cookbook folder
│   └── (recipes)       (10000000+) ← Level 8 content
├── initial-setup.md    (1000003) ← Level 7 (Component 1)
└── quick-start.md      (1000004) ← Level 7 (Component 2)
```

**Weight Calculation:**

Path: `/en/` (1) → `/learn/` (2) → `/swe/` (3) → `/programming-languages/` (4) → `/[language]/` (5) → `/tutorials/` (6) → `/cookbook/` (7)

- `cookbook/` is a **level 7 folder** (child of tutorials/)
- `cookbook/_index.md` represents the folder at level 7 → **weight: 1000002** (3rd child in tutorials/)
- Recipe files inside cookbook/ → **weight: 10000000+** (level 8 content)

**Understanding Weight Resets Across Sibling Folders:**

```
# PASS: GOOD: Category folders at level 6, content inside at level 7 with resets
tutorials/
├── _index.md           (100002) ← Level 6 (represents tutorials folder, 3rd sibling)
├── overview.md         (1000000) ← Level 7 base (content inside tutorials/)

how-to/
├── _index.md           (100003) ← Level 6 (represents how-to folder, 4th sibling)
├── overview.md         (1000000) ← Level 7 base RESET (different parent, content inside how-to/)

explanation/
├── _index.md           (100004) ← Level 6 (represents explanation folder, 5th sibling)
├── overview.md         (1000000) ← Level 7 base RESET (different parent, content inside explanation/)

reference/
├── _index.md           (100005) ← Level 6 (represents reference folder, 6th sibling)
├── overview.md         (1000000) ← Level 7 base RESET (different parent, content inside reference/)
```

**RESET Explanation:** Different parent folders independently use the same base weight (1000000) for their children. Hugo only compares siblings (files with the same parent), so `tutorials/overview.md` (1000000) and `how-to/overview.md` (1000000) never conflict - they have different parents and appear in different navigation contexts.

**Weight System Summary:**

- **Level 5** (language folder): Language folder's `_index.md` at 10002
- **Level 6** (content inside language folder): `overview.md` at 100000, category folders' `_index.md` at 100002, 100003, 100004...
- **Level 7** (content inside category folders): 1000000, 1000001, 1000002... (resets per category parent)
- Follows ayokoding-web's level-based system: folder at level N has `_index.md` at level N, content inside at level N+1

## Coverage Philosophy

### The 0-95% Proficiency Scale

Each tutorial level targets a specific knowledge coverage range:

| Component                | Coverage  | Purpose                                          | Length            |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **FULL SET PACKAGE**     | **0-95%** | **Complete language education**                  | **13K-18K lines** |
| ↳ Foundational (2 files) | 0-30%     | Prerequisites for all learning                   | 900-1,400 lines   |
| ↳ By-Example (3 files)   | 95%       | **PRIORITY:** Code-first, move fast (75-85 ex's) | 3,500-4,500 lines |
| ↳ By-Concept (3 files)   | 95%       | Narrative-driven, learn deep                     | 3,200-5,500 lines |
| ↳ Cookbook (1+ files)    | Practical | Problem-solving recipes                          | 4,000-5,500 lines |

**Critical Understanding:**

- Coverage percentages measure **knowledge depth**, NOT time investment
- Different learners progress at different speeds (respects No Time Estimates principle)
- Percentages provide **scope boundaries** for content creators
- "95%" is the ceiling - no tutorial claims 100% coverage (humility principle)

1. **Front Hook** (first paragraph)
   - Format: "**Want to [achieve outcome]?** This [tutorial type] [value proposition]."
   - Example: "**Want to get productive with Python fast?** This Quick Start teaches you the essential syntax and core patterns you need to read Python code and try simple examples independently."

2. **Learning Path Visualization**
   - Mermaid diagram showing concept progression
   - Use color-blind friendly palette: Blue (#0173B2), Orange (#DE8F05), Teal (#029E73)
   - Example structure: Concept A → Concept B → Concept C → Ready!

3. **Prerequisites Section**
   - Clear entry requirements
   - Links to prerequisite tutorials
   - Tool/version requirements

4. **Coverage Declaration**

### Qualitative Requirements

All content MUST meet:

- PASS: **Color-blind friendly**: Only use approved palette (#0173B2, #DE8F05, #029E73, #CC78BC, #CA9161)
- PASS: **Factually accurate**: All commands, syntax, versions verified
- PASS: **Runnable code**: Examples work as-is (copy-paste ready)
- PASS: **Progressive disclosure**: Simple → complex ordering
- PASS: **Active voice**: Direct, engaging writing
- PASS: **Single H1**: Only one top-level heading per file
- PASS: **Proper heading nesting**: No skipped levels (H2 → H4)
- PASS: **No time estimates**: Focus on outcomes, not duration
- PASS: **Cross-platform**: Consider Windows, macOS, Linux where relevant

## Language-Agnostic vs. Language-Specific

### Universal Elements (Same Across All Languages)

These MUST be identical:

- Directory structure and file names
- Coverage percentages (0-5%, 5-30%, 0-60%, 60-85%, 85-95%)
- Diátaxis categorization (tutorials, how-to, explanation, reference)
- Pedagogical patterns (front hook, learning path, prerequisites)
- Quality requirements (color palette, no time estimates, runnable code)
- Weight numbering (level-based system: level 5 folder uses 10002, level 6 content uses 100000+, level 7 content uses 1000000+ with resets per parent)
- Frontmatter structure (title, date, draft, description, weight)

### Customizable Elements (Adapt Per Language)

These vary by language:

- **Number of how-to guides**: 12-18 based on language complexity
- **Specific topics**:
  - Go: goroutines, channels, interfaces
  - Python: GIL, decorators, comprehensions
  - Java: JVM, threads, generics
  - Rust: ownership, lifetimes, borrowing
  - TypeScript: type system, generics, decorators
- **Philosophy sections**: Language design principles
- **Ecosystem tools**:
  - Go: modules, go fmt
  - Python: pip, venv, poetry
  - Java: Maven, Gradle, JUnit
- **Paradigm emphasis**:
  - Go: concurrent programming
  - Python: multi-paradigm flexibility
  - Java: object-oriented design
  - Rust: memory safety
  - Clojure: functional programming

## Content Density Patterns

From benchmark analysis:

- **Quick Start = 40-50% of Beginner length**: Enables rapid exploration without overwhelming
- **Intermediate = 60-80% of Beginner length**: Assumes foundation, focuses on production patterns
- **Cookbook = 2-3x Beginner length**: Comprehensive reference with many recipes
- **How-to guides average 300-400 lines**: Focused, actionable solutions
- **Best practices ≈ Anti-patterns length**: Balanced positive/negative examples

**Rationale:** These ratios have proven effective across three languages with different complexities.

## Validation Process

### During Creation

Content creators MUST:

1. **Use apps-ayokoding-web-general-maker or apps-ayokoding-web-by-example-maker agent** for initial content creation
2. **Follow this standard exactly** (don't improvise structure)
3. **Test all code examples** (ensure they run)
4. **Verify factual accuracy** (check documentation, official sources)
5. **Use color-blind friendly palette** (never red/green/yellow)

### Before Publishing

Content MUST pass:

1. **apps-ayokoding-web-general-checker** or **apps-ayokoding-web-by-example-checker** validation (Hugo conventions, quality principles)
2. **apps-ayokoding-web-facts-checker** verification (factual correctness)
3. **apps-ayokoding-web-link-checker** validation (all links work)
4. **Manual review** (pedagogical effectiveness, clarity)

### Post-Publishing

Monitor and maintain:

1. **Quarterly fact checks** (verify versions, syntax still current)
2. **User feedback** (address confusion, gaps)
3. **Update for language evolution** (new versions, deprecated features)

## Replication Formula

To add a new programming language:

1. **Clone structure** from reference language (Golang, Python, or Java)
2. **Adapt coverage levels** to language paradigm
3. **Map touchpoints** to language-specific concepts
4. **Write 5 tutorials** following pedagogical patterns
5. **Identify 12-18 common problems** for how-to guides
6. **Create cookbook** with 30+ recipes
7. **Document philosophy** in best-practices and anti-patterns
8. **Add Mermaid diagrams** with approved color palette
9. **Validate against metrics** (line counts, cross-references, code examples)
10. **Run validation agents** (content-checker, facts-checker, link-checker)

See [How to Add a Programming Language](../../../docs/how-to/hoto__add-programming-language.md) for detailed step-by-step instructions.

## Highest Standards Reference

Following comprehensive analysis of all 6 programming languages (Python, Golang, Java, Kotlin, Rust, Elixir) in December 2025, **Elixir** has been identified as the highest standard reference implementation for most content types.

**Key Finding:** Elixir, being the most recently added language (December 2024), most closely follows this Programming Language Content Standard and serves as the reference implementation for:

- **All 5 Tutorials** (initial-setup, quick-start, beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- **Cookbook** (5625 lines, weight 1000001, 52 cross-references)
- **Best Practices** (1075 lines, 98 code examples)
- **Anti-Patterns** (1054 lines, 76 code examples)

**Alternative Excellence:**

- **Cheat Sheet:** Golang (1404 lines) - most comprehensive syntax reference
- **Glossary:** Java (1873 lines, 128 code examples) - most comprehensive terminology
- **Resources:** Java (879 lines) - most comprehensive external links
- **Diagram Usage:** Golang beginner tutorial (6 diagrams) - visual learning reference

**Complete Reference Table:** Detailed metrics (line counts, code blocks, diagrams, links) for all 11 content types are available in the prog-lang-parity plan documentation.

**Usage Guidance:**

- **When creating new language content:** Use Elixir tutorials as templates for structure, depth, and code example patterns
- **When improving existing content:** Compare to Elixir benchmarks (should be within 20% of line counts for same content type)
- **For diagram patterns:** Reference Golang beginner tutorial (6 diagrams showing concept progression)
- **For cross-references:** Reference Elixir cookbook (52 links) as target for learning path integration

**Quality Gaps Identified (Even in Highest Standards):**

Even Elixir, the highest standard, has gaps:

1. **Front Hooks:** Missing in all 30 tutorials across all 6 languages (0% compliance)
2. **Cross-References in Tutorials:** Elixir tutorials have 0-5 links (target: 10+ per tutorial)
3. **Color Violations:** Elixir has 8 color violations that need fixing

**Implication:** Achieving complete parity requires going beyond current highest standards in pedagogical patterns (front hooks, cross-references) and color compliance.

**Analysis Report:** Complete parity analysis with detailed gap identification available in `plans/in-progress/2025-12-21__prog-lang-parity/analysis-report.md`
