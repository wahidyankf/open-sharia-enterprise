# Cookbook Tutorial Convention

## Purpose

This convention **extends the [Tutorials Convention](./general.md) for the Cookbook tutorial type**, defining specialized standards for problem-focused learning through practical, copy-paste ready recipes organized by problem type rather than difficulty level.

**Base requirements**: Cookbook tutorials inherit general tutorial standards (learning-oriented approach, visual completeness, hands-on elements from [Tutorials Convention](./general.md)) and add recipe-specific specializations defined below.

**Target audience**: Developers at any level (beginner to advanced) seeking practical solutions to specific real-world problems. Unlike sequential learning paths, cookbook recipes can be consumed in any order based on current needs.

## Structure Integration with General Tutorial Standards

Cookbook tutorials adapt the general [Tutorial Convention](./general.md) structure for problem-solving:

### Adaptation of General Structure

**Traditional Tutorial Structure** (from [Tutorials Convention](./general.md)):

- Introduction → Prerequisites → Objectives → Content Sections → Challenges → Summary → Next Steps

**Cookbook Structure Adaptation**:

1. **Cookbook overview** (serves as introduction):
   - Purpose and scope of cookbook
   - How to use cookbook effectively
   - Organization by problem category
   - Cross-references to by-concept and by-example tracks

2. **Recipe organization** (replaces sequential sections):
   - Organized by problem category (not difficulty level)
   - Each recipe solves one specific problem
   - Recipes are self-contained and independent
   - 30+ recipes across multiple categories

3. **Recipe structure** (replaces traditional content sections):
   - Problem statement (what needs to be solved)
   - Solution code (copy-paste ready with annotations)
   - Explanation (how it works, why this approach)
   - Common pitfalls (what to avoid)
   - Related recipes (cross-references)

4. **No sequential progression**:
   - Recipes can be read in any order
   - Same recipe may be useful at different skill levels
   - Problem-focused, not learning-path focused

### Inherited Requirements from General Tutorial Convention

Cookbook tutorials MUST follow these general tutorial standards:

- PASS: **Learning-oriented approach** (Diátaxis framework): Teach through solving real problems
- PASS: **Visual completeness**: Diagrams when helpful for understanding solutions
- PASS: **Hands-on elements**: Every recipe has runnable, copy-paste ready code
- PASS: **No time estimates**: Focus on problem solved, not time to implement
- PASS: **Accessibility**: Color-blind friendly diagrams, clear structure
- PASS: **Real-world relevance**: Every recipe solves an actual production problem

### Specialized Requirements for Cookbook

Beyond general tutorial standards, cookbook adds:

- PASS: **Problem-focused organization**: By problem type, not difficulty level
- PASS: **Copy-paste readiness**: Code works as-is with minimal modification
- PASS: **Recipe independence**: Each recipe self-contained, no required reading order
- PASS: **Cross-level applicability**: Same recipe useful for beginner and advanced developers
- PASS: **Practical emphasis**: Minimal theory, maximum working code
- PASS: **Recipe count**: 30+ recipes covering common problem domains

## Core Characteristics

### 1. Problem-Focused Approach

**Philosophy**: Organize by "what problem does this solve" not "what topic does this teach".

Recipes prioritize:

- Specific problem statements over broad topics
- Working solutions over educational explanations
- Practical utility over theoretical completeness
- Copy-paste readiness over step-by-step guidance

### 2. Coverage Target: Practical Problem Domains

**What "30+ recipes" means**: Breadth across common problem categories developers encounter in production.

**Problem categories to cover**:

- **Setup and Configuration** - Environment setup, tool configuration, dependency management
- **Data Manipulation** - Parsing, transforming, validating, serializing data
- **File Operations** - Reading, writing, processing files (CSV, JSON, XML, etc.)
- **Network and HTTP** - API calls, request handling, error handling, authentication
- **Concurrency and Parallelism** - Async operations, threading, race conditions
- **Testing and Debugging** - Test setup, mocking, debugging techniques
- **Performance Optimization** - Profiling, caching, optimization patterns
- **Error Handling** - Exception patterns, error recovery, logging
- **Security** - Input validation, authentication, authorization patterns
- **Database Operations** - CRUD operations, transactions, query optimization

**Not included** (covered elsewhere):

- Comprehensive language features (that's by-concept)
- Sequential learning examples (that's by-example)
- Project-specific implementations (that's how-to guides)

### 3. Recipe Independence

**What independence means**: Each recipe can be understood and used without reading other recipes.

**Self-containment rules**:

- Recipe includes all necessary imports/dependencies
- Problem context is stated clearly upfront
- No assumptions about prior recipe reading
- Cross-references are optional, not required

**Different from by-example**:

- By-example: Sequential examples building on each other (1→85)
- Cookbook: Independent recipes in any order

### 4. Cross-Level Applicability

**What cross-level means**: Same recipe useful regardless of developer skill level.

A beginner might use a recipe to solve an immediate problem.
An intermediate developer might study the recipe to understand the pattern.
An advanced developer might reference the recipe for syntax or edge cases.

**Different from by-concept**:

- By-concept: Separate beginner/intermediate/advanced files
- Cookbook: Single recipe serves all levels (problem is the organizing principle)

## Recipe Structure Standards

Each cookbook recipe MUST follow this structure:

### 1. Recipe Title

**Format**: `## Recipe: [Problem Statement]`

**Examples**:

- `## Recipe: Read CSV File with Headers`
- `## Recipe: Retry Failed API Calls with Exponential Backoff`
- `## Recipe: Parse JSON with Unknown Schema`

**Requirements**:

- Clear problem statement (what this solves)
- Action-oriented (verb + object)
- Specific enough to be searchable
- No difficulty indicators (not "Beginner: Read CSV")

### 2. Problem Statement

**Format**: 1-3 sentences describing the specific problem.

**Example**:

```markdown
### Problem

You need to read a CSV file with headers into a list of objects, handling missing values and type conversions automatically. The CSV may have inconsistent formatting (extra spaces, quoted fields).
```

**Requirements**:

- State the problem clearly and specifically
- Include constraints or edge cases
- Mention common pain points
- Keep focused (one problem per recipe)

### 3. Solution

**Format**: Annotated code with `// =>` or `# =>` notation showing the complete solution.

**Example**:

```go
package main

import (
    "encoding/csv"     // => Standard library CSV parser
    "os"               // => For file operations
    "strings"          // => For trimming whitespace
)

func readCSV(filepath string) ([]map[string]string, error) {
    file, err := os.Open(filepath)  // => Open file for reading
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err             // => Return error if file doesn't exist
    }
    defer file.Close()              // => Ensure file is closed when done

    reader := csv.NewReader(file)   // => Create CSV reader
    reader.TrimLeadingSpace = true  // => Remove extra spaces automatically

    headers, err := reader.Read()   // => Read first row as headers
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    var records []map[string]string // => Store results as key-value maps
    for {
        row, err := reader.Read()   // => Read each subsequent row
        if err == io.EOF {          // => End of file reached
            break
        }
        if err != nil {
            return nil, err         // => Handle malformed CSV
        }

        record := make(map[string]string)
        for i, value := range row {
            if i < len(headers) {   // => Prevent index out of bounds
                record[headers[i]] = value
            }
        }
        records = append(records, record)
    }

    return records, nil
}
```

**Requirements**:

- Complete, runnable code (not pseudocode)
- Copy-paste ready with all imports
- Annotations using `// =>` or `# =>` notation
- Annotation density: 0.5-1.5 lines per code line (lighter than by-example's 1-2.25)
- Focus annotations on "what this does" not "why we need this"

### 4. How It Works

**Format**: 2-4 paragraphs explaining the solution approach.

**Example**:

```markdown
### How It Works

This solution uses Go's standard library `encoding/csv` package which handles most edge cases automatically. The key insight is treating the first row as headers and mapping subsequent rows to key-value pairs.

The `TrimLeadingSpace` option handles inconsistent formatting without manual preprocessing. By reading one row at a time, this approach works efficiently even with large CSV files.

The error handling covers three cases: file not found, malformed headers, and malformed data rows. Each error is returned immediately rather than collecting errors, following Go's fail-fast philosophy.
```

**Requirements**:

- Explain the approach, not the syntax
- Highlight key insights or patterns
- Mention why this approach works well
- Keep concise (don't duplicate code comments)

### 5. Common Pitfalls

**Format**: Bulleted list of mistakes to avoid.

**Example**:

```markdown
### Common Pitfalls

- **Not checking header length**: If a row has more columns than headers, indexing fails. Always validate `i < len(headers)`.
- **Forgetting to close file**: Without `defer file.Close()`, files stay open until program exits.
- **Assuming consistent encoding**: CSV files may use different encodings (UTF-8, Latin-1). Use `golang.org/x/text/encoding` for non-UTF-8 files.
- **Not handling quoted fields**: Fields containing commas must be quoted. The standard `csv.Reader` handles this, but custom parsers often don't.
```

**Requirements**:

- 3-5 common mistakes
- Each with brief explanation
- Actionable (what to do instead)
- Based on real production errors

### 6. Related Recipes

**Format**: Bulleted list linking to related recipes.

**Example**:

```markdown
### Related Recipes

- **Write CSV with Custom Headers** - Reverse operation, writing data to CSV
- **Parse JSON with Schema Validation** - Similar problem for JSON instead of CSV
- **Handle Large Files with Streaming** - Memory-efficient approach for huge CSV files
```

**Requirements**:

- 2-4 related recipes
- Brief description of relationship
- Links when recipes exist
- Helps readers discover related solutions

### 7. Learn More (Optional)

**Format**: Links to related learning content in by-concept or by-example.

**Example**:

```markdown
### Learn More

- **By-Concept: File I/O** - Comprehensive coverage of file operations and error handling patterns
- **By-Example: Example 23** - More CSV parsing examples with different formats
```

**Requirements**:

- Optional (include when helpful)
- Links to comprehensive learning paths
- Helps readers deepen understanding beyond immediate problem

## Recipe Organization and Naming

### Directory Structure

```

└── database/                          # Database recipes
```

### Recipe Naming Convention

**Pattern**: `recipe-[NN]-[problem-identifier].md`

**Examples**:

- `recipe-01-read-csv-with-headers.md`
- `recipe-02-retry-failed-api-calls.md`
- `recipe-03-parse-json-unknown-schema.md`

**Requirements**:

- Sequential numbering within category (01, 02, 03...)
- Kebab-case problem identifier
- Descriptive enough to search
- No difficulty indicators in name

### Category Organization

**Each category should have**:

- 3-5 recipes minimum
- Clear category scope
- `_index.md` with category overview
- Logical grouping by problem domain

**Category selection criteria**:

- Common enough to warrant 3+ recipes
- Distinct from other categories
- Aligned with production problem domains
- Searchable/discoverable

## Quality Standards

### Recipe Completeness Checklist

Each recipe MUST have:

- ✅ Clear problem statement (1-3 sentences)
- ✅ Complete solution code (copy-paste ready)
- ✅ Code annotations (0.5-1.5 per line)
- ✅ How It Works explanation (2-4 paragraphs)
- ✅ Common Pitfalls list (3-5 items)
- ✅ Related Recipes links (2-4 items)
- ✅ Self-contained (all imports, no external dependencies on other recipes)

### Code Quality Standards

- **Runnable**: Code must work as-is (not pseudocode)
- **Production-ready**: Use real error handling, not TODO comments
- **Idiomatic**: Follow language conventions and best practices
- **Minimal**: Solve the problem without extra complexity
- **Annotated**: Use `// =>` or `# =>` for state/output annotations

### Annotation Density

**Target**: 0.5-1.5 comment lines per code line

**Rationale**: Cookbook code is copy-paste oriented, so annotations focus on "what this does" rather than educational "why we need this". Lighter annotation than by-example (1-2.25) but still helpful.

**Examples**:

```go
// GOOD: Concise annotation focused on action
file, err := os.Open(filepath)  // => Open file for reading
```

```go
// TOO MUCH: Over-explaining (by-example style, not cookbook style)
file, err := os.Open(filepath)  // => Open file for reading
                                // => os.Open returns (*File, error)
                                // => File is a handle to the opened file
                                // => We'll use this to create a CSV reader
```

```go
// TOO LITTLE: No annotation (reader must infer)
file, err := os.Open(filepath)
```
