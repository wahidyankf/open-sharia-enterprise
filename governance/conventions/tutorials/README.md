# Tutorial Conventions

Standards for creating learning-oriented tutorial content. These conventions answer the question: **"How do I CREATE tutorials?"**

## Purpose

This directory contains standards for tutorial creation, structure, naming, and content that apply to **all tutorial content** across the repository (docs/, ayokoding-web, oseplatform-web, anywhere). These conventions **build upon and extend** the universal [writing conventions](../writing/README.md).

## Documents
