# Content Conventions

Content quality standards, validation methodology, and writing guidelines for all repository documentation.

## Purpose

These conventions define **WHAT content quality standards apply** to documentation, covering writing style, validation methodology, and quality principles. All content must follow these standards regardless of location (docs/, Hugo sites, plans/, root files).

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Content quality standards and checklists
- Validation methodology for factual correctness
- Writing guidelines and style rules
- README and OSS documentation standards
- Meta-convention for writing conventions

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Markdown formatting syntax (that's formatting/)
- Tutorial-specific standards (that's tutorial/)
- Hugo-specific content rules (that's hugo/)

## Conventions

- [Content Quality Principles](./quality.md) - Universal markdown content quality standards (writing style, heading hierarchy, accessibility, formatting)
- [Convention Writing](./convention-writing.md) - **Meta-convention** defining how to write and organize convention documents
- [Factual Validation](./factual-validation.md) - Universal methodology for validating factual correctness using web verification
- [OSS Documentation](./oss-documentation.md) - Standards for repository documentation files (README, CONTRIBUTING, ADRs, security)
- [README Quality](./readme-quality.md) - Quality standards for README.md files (engagement, accessibility, scannability)

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This set of conventions implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[Accessibility First](../../principles/content/accessibility-first.md)**: Content quality standards include active voice, proper heading hierarchy, and WCAG AA compliance to ensure documentation is accessible to all users.

- **[Documentation First](../../principles/content/documentation-first.md)**: Conventions establish mandatory documentation standards, treating documentation as an integral part of development rather than an optional afterthought.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Convention Writing Convention defines explicit structure for documentation, making rules and standards transparent rather than implicit or magical.
