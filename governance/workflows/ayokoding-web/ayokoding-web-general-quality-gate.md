# AyoKoding Content General Quality Gate Workflow

**Purpose**: Comprehensively validate all ayokoding-web content (Hugo conventions, factual accuracy, structure, links), apply fixes iteratively until all issues are resolved, then regenerate titles and navigation.

**When to use**:

- After creating or updating ayokoding-web content
- Before deploying ayokoding-web to production
- Periodically to ensure content quality and accuracy
- After bulk content changes or restructuring

## Execution Mode

**Current Mode**: Manual Orchestration (see [Workflow Execution Modes Convention](../meta/execution-modes.md))

This workflow is currently executed through **manual orchestration** where the AI assistant (Claude Code or OpenCode) follows workflow steps directly using Read/Write/Edit tools. File changes persist to the actual filesystem.

**How to Execute**:

```
User: "Run ayokoding-web general quality gate workflow for ayokoding-web/content/en/ in manual mode"
```

The AI will:

1. Execute all four checkers logic directly in parallel (general, facts, structure, links - validate, write audits)
2. Execute all three fixers logic directly in sequence (general, facts, structure - read audits, apply fixes, write fix reports)
3. Iterate until zero findings achieved across all validators
4. Execute title-maker logic directly (regenerate titles from filenames)
5. Execute navigation-maker logic directly (regenerate 2-layer navigation)
6. Show git status with modified files
7. Wait for user commit approval

**Why Manual Mode?**: Task tool runs agents in isolated contexts where file changes don't persist. Manual orchestration ensures audit reports, content fixes, title updates, and navigation regeneration are actually written to the filesystem.

## Steps

### 1. Parallel Validation (Parallel)

Run all ayokoding validators concurrently to identify all issues across different quality dimensions.

**Agent 1a**: `apps-ayokoding-web-general-checker`

- **Args**: `scope: {input.scope}`
- **Output**: `{content-report-N}` - Hugo conventions, bilingual consistency, navigation validation

**Agent 1b**: `apps-ayokoding-web-facts-checker`

- **Args**: `scope: {input.scope}`
- **Output**: `{facts-report-N}` - Factual accuracy, code examples, tutorial sequences

**Agent 1c**: `apps-ayokoding-web-structure-checker`

- **Args**: `scope: {input.scope}`
- **Output**: `{structure-report-N}` - Weight conventions, ordering, navigation structure

**Agent 1d**: `apps-ayokoding-web-link-checker`

- **Args**: `scope: {input.scope}`
- **Output**: `{links-report-N}` - Internal/external link validation, Hugo link format

**Success criteria**: All four checkers complete and generate audit reports.

**On failure**: Terminate workflow with status `fail`.

**Notes**:

- All checkers run in parallel for efficiency
- Each generates independent audit report in `generated-reports/`
- Reports use progressive writing to survive context compaction

### 2. Aggregate Findings (Sequential)

Analyze all audit reports to determine if fixes are needed.

**Condition Check**: Count ALL findings (HIGH, MEDIUM, and MINOR) across all four reports

- If total findings > 0: Proceed to step 3
- If total findings = 0: Skip to step 7 (Finalization)

**Depends on**: Step 1 completion

**Notes**:

- Considers ALL findings from all four validation dimensions
- Fixes everything: HIGH (objective), MEDIUM (structural), MINOR (style/formatting)
- Tracks findings by category for observability
- Achieves perfect content quality state

### 3. Apply Content Fixes (Sequential, Conditional)

Fix Hugo convention violations, frontmatter issues, and content quality problems.

**Agent**: `apps-ayokoding-web-general-fixer`

- **Args**: `report: {step1.outputs.content-report-N}, approved: all`
- **Output**: `{content-fixes-applied}`
- **Condition**: Content findings exist from step 2
- **Depends on**: Step 2 completion

**Success criteria**: Fixer successfully applies content fixes without errors.

**On failure**: Log errors, continue to next fixer.

### 4. Apply Facts Fixes (Sequential, Conditional)

Fix factual errors, outdated information, and incorrect code examples.

**Agent**: `apps-ayokoding-web-facts-fixer`

- **Args**: `report: {step1.outputs.facts-report-N}, approved: all`
- **Output**: `{facts-fixes-applied}`
- **Condition**: Facts findings exist from step 2
- **Depends on**: Step 3 completion

**Success criteria**: Fixer successfully applies factual fixes without errors.

**On failure**: Log errors, continue to next fixer.

**Notes**:

- Uses web verification to ensure accuracy
- Re-validates findings before applying
- Preserves educational content intent

### 5. Apply Structure Fixes (Sequential, Conditional)

Fix weight ordering, navigation structure, and coverage issues.

**Agent**: `apps-ayokoding-web-structure-fixer`

- **Args**: `report: {step1.outputs.structure-report-N}, approved: all`
- **Output**: `{structure-fixes-applied}`
- **Condition**: Structure findings exist from step 2
- **Depends on**: Step 4 completion

**Success criteria**: Fixer successfully applies structure fixes without errors.

**On failure**: Log errors, proceed to re-validation.

**Notes**:

- Adjusts weights to maintain proper ordering
- Fixes navigation structure issues
- Does NOT regenerate navigation (that happens in step 8)

### 6. Iteration Control (Sequential)

Determine whether to continue fixing or move to finalization.

**Logic**:

- Re-run all checkers (step 1) to get fresh reports
- Count ALL findings (HIGH, MEDIUM, MINOR) across all new reports
- If findings = 0 AND iterations >= min-iterations (or min not provided): Proceed to step 7 (Finalization)
- If findings = 0 AND iterations < min-iterations: Loop back to step 3 (need more iterations)
- If findings > 0 AND max-iterations provided AND iterations >= max-iterations: Proceed to step 7 with status `partial`
- If findings > 0 AND (max-iterations not provided OR iterations < max-iterations): Loop back to step 3

**Depends on**: Step 5 completion

**Notes**:

- **Default behavior**: Runs indefinitely until zero findings (no max-iterations limit)
- **Optional min-iterations**: Prevents premature termination before sufficient iterations
- **Optional max-iterations**: Prevents infinite loops when explicitly provided
- Each iteration gets fresh validation reports across all four validators
- Tracks iteration count and finding trends

### 7. Regenerate Titles (Sequential)

Update title fields in all ayokoding-web markdown files based on filenames and configuration.

**Agent**: `apps-ayokoding-web-title-maker`

- **Args**: `scope: {input.scope}`
- **Output**: `{titles-updated}`
- **Depends on**: Zero findings or max-iterations reached

**Success criteria**: All titles regenerated successfully.

**On failure**: Log errors, continue to navigation regeneration.

**Notes**:

- Runs after all fixes applied
- Updates titles based on filename conventions
- Handles language-specific title overrides

### 8. Regenerate Navigation (Sequential)

Regenerate 2-layer navigation listings in all \_index.md files from file structure.

**Agent**: `apps-ayokoding-web-navigation-maker`

- **Args**: `scope: {input.scope}`
- **Output**: `{navigation-updated}`
- **Depends on**: Step 7 completion

**Success criteria**: All navigation listings regenerated successfully.

**On failure**: Terminate workflow with status `fail`.

**Notes**:

- Runs AFTER title regeneration (titles affect navigation)
- Automatically generates 2-layer navigation from file structure
- Ensures complete navigation coverage

### 9. Final Validation (Sequential)

Run all checkers one final time to confirm zero issues remain.

**Agents**: All four checkers in parallel

- apps-ayokoding-web-general-checker
- apps-ayokoding-web-facts-checker
- apps-ayokoding-web-structure-checker
- apps-ayokoding-web-link-checker

**Args**: `scope: {input.scope}, expect: zero-issues`

**Output**: Final audit reports for all dimensions

**Success criteria**: All checkers report zero issues of ANY confidence level.

**On failure**: Set status to `partial`.

**Depends on**: Step 8 completion

### 10. Finalization (Sequential)

Report final status and summary.

**Output**: `{final-status}`, `{iterations-completed}`, all final reports

**Status determination**:

- **Success** (`pass`): Zero findings after final validation
- **Partial** (`partial`): Findings remain after max-iterations OR final validation failed
- **Failure** (`fail`): Technical errors during check, fix, or finalization

**Depends on**: Step 9 completion

## Termination Criteria

- PASS: **Success** (`pass`): Zero findings of ANY confidence level (HIGH, MEDIUM, MINOR) across all validators after finalization
- **Partial** (`partial`): Any findings remain after max-iterations OR final validation found issues
- FAIL: **Failure** (`fail`): Checkers, fixers, or finalization agents encountered technical errors

## Example Usage

### Full Content Check-Fix

```
User: "Run ayokoding-web general quality gate workflow in manual mode"
```

The AI will execute the workflow directly:

- Validate all ayokoding-web content in parallel (general, facts, structure, links)
- Fix all findings (general-fixer, facts-fixer, structure-fixer logic)
- Regenerate titles and navigation
- Iterate until zero findings achieved

### Validate Specific Language

```
User: "Run ayokoding-web general quality gate workflow for ayokoding-web/content/en/"
```

The AI will execute with language-scoped validation:

- Validate only English content
- Fix issues in English files only
- Regenerate titles and navigation for English content

### Validate Specific Section

```
User: "Run ayokoding-web general quality gate workflow for ayokoding-web/content/en/programming/"
```

The AI will execute with section-scoped validation:

- Validate only programming section
- Fix issues in that section
- Regenerate titles and navigation for affected files

### With Iteration Bounds

```
User: "Run ayokoding-web general quality gate workflow with min-iterations=2 and max-iterations=10"
```

The AI will execute with iteration controls:

- Require at least 2 check-fix cycles
- Cap at maximum 10 iterations
- Report final status after completion

## Iteration Example

Typical execution flow:

```
Iteration 1:
  Parallel Check (4 validators) → 25 total findings
    - Content: 10 findings
    - Facts: 8 findings
    - Structure: 5 findings
    - Links: 2 findings
  Sequential Fix → Content → Facts → Structure
  Re-check → 8 findings remain

Iteration 2:
  Parallel Check → 8 findings
  Sequential Fix → Content → Facts → Structure
  Re-check → 0 findings

Finalization:
  Regenerate Titles → Success
  Regenerate Navigation → Success
  Final Validation → Zero issues

Result: SUCCESS (2 iterations)
```

## Safety Features

**Infinite Loop Prevention**:

- Optional max-iterations parameter (no default - runs until zero findings)
- When provided, workflow terminates with `partial` if limit reached
- Tracks iteration count and finding trends
- Use max-iterations when fix convergence is uncertain

**False Positive Protection**:

- All fixers re-validate findings before applying
- Skips FALSE_POSITIVE findings automatically
- Progressive writing ensures audit history survives

**Error Recovery**:

- Continues to next fixer even if one fails
- Continues to finalization even if fixes partially fail
- Reports which fixes succeeded/failed
- Generates final reports regardless of status

**Comprehensive Coverage**:

- Four validation dimensions (content, facts, structure, links)
- Parallel validation for efficiency
- Sequential fixing for dependency management
- Post-fix regeneration for consistency

## Related Workflows

This workflow can be composed with:

- Deployment workflows (validate before deploying ayokoding-web)
- Content creation workflows (validate after bulk content creation)
- Translation workflows (validate bilingual consistency)

## Success Metrics

Track across executions:

- **Average iterations to completion**: How many cycles typically needed
- **Success rate**: Percentage reaching zero findings
- **Findings by dimension**: Which validators find most issues
- **Fix success rate**: Percentage of fixes applied without errors
- **Common issue categories**: What problems appear most frequently

## Notes

- **Fully automated**: No human checkpoints, runs to completion
- **Comprehensive**: Validates all quality dimensions
- **Parallel validation**: Efficient checking across dimensions
- **Sequential fixing**: Manages dependencies between fixers
- **Post-fix regeneration**: Ensures titles and navigation are current
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
