# Software Engineering Documentation Separation Quality Gate Workflow

**Purpose**: Automatically validate separation between OSE Platform style guides (docs/explanation/software-engineering/) and AyoKoding educational content (apps/ayokoding-web/), then apply fixes iteratively until all separation violations are resolved.

**IMPORTANT - Validation Scope**:

This workflow validates **ONLY** explicit relationships listed in the Software Design Reference prerequisite table:

- **Validates**: Relationships explicitly opted-in (Java, Golang, Elixir, JVM Spring, JVM Spring Boot)
- **Skips**: Languages/frameworks not in prerequisite table (TypeScript, Python, etc.)
- **Why**: Enables incremental migration - validate only explicitly defined relationships

**When to use**:

- After adding new prerequisite relationships to Software Design Reference
- After updating docs/explanation style guide content
- After updating AyoKoding educational content
- Before major releases to ensure no educational content duplicated in style guides
- Periodically to ensure separation compliance

## Execution Mode

**Current Mode**: Manual Orchestration (see [Workflow Execution Modes Convention](../meta/execution-modes.md))

This workflow is currently executed through **manual orchestration** where the AI assistant follows workflow steps directly using Read/Write/Edit tools. File changes persist to the actual filesystem.

**How to Execute**:

```
User: "Run docs software engineering separation quality gate workflow in manual mode"
```

The AI will:

1. Execute docs-software-engineering-separation-checker logic directly (read, validate, write audit)
2. Execute docs-software-engineering-separation-fixer logic directly (read audit, apply fixes, write fix report)
3. Iterate until zero findings achieved
4. Show git status with modified files
5. Wait for user commit approval

**Why Manual Mode?**: Task tool runs agents in isolated contexts where file changes don't persist. Manual orchestration ensures audit reports and fixes are actually written to the filesystem.

## Steps

### 1. Initial Validation (Sequential)

Run software engineering documentation separation check to identify violations.

**Agent**: `docs-software-engineering-separation-checker`

- **Args**: `scope: {input.scope}`
- **Output**: `{audit-report-1}` - Initial audit report in `generated-reports/` (4-part format: `docs-swe-sep__{uuid-chain}__{timestamp}__audit.md`)

**Success criteria**: Checker completes and generates audit report.

**On failure**: Terminate workflow with status `fail`.

### 2. Check for Findings (Sequential)

Analyze audit report to determine if fixes are needed.

**Condition Check**: Count ALL findings (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM) in `{step1.outputs.audit-report-1}`

- If findings > 0: Proceed to step 3
- If findings = 0: Skip to step 6 (Success)

**Depends on**: Step 1 completion

**Notes**:

- Validates NO DUPLICATION between docs/explanation and AyoKoding
- Checks prerequisite statements exist and reference AyoKoding correctly
- Validates style guide focus on repository-specific conventions only

### 3. Apply Fixes (Sequential, Conditional)

Apply all validated fixes from the audit report.

**Agent**: `docs-software-engineering-separation-fixer`

- **Args**: `report: {step1.outputs.audit-report-1}, approved: all`
- **Output**: `{fixes-applied}`
- **Condition**: Findings exist from step 2
- **Depends on**: Step 2 completion

**Success criteria**: Fixer successfully applies all fixes without errors.

**On failure**: Log errors, proceed to step 4 for verification.

**Notes**:

- Fixer re-validates findings before applying (prevents false positives)
- Adds missing prerequisite statements
- Removes duplicated educational content from style guides
- Ensures docs/explanation focuses on repository-specific conventions

### 4. Re-validate (Sequential)

Run checker again to verify fixes resolved issues and no new issues introduced.

**Agent**: `docs-software-engineering-separation-checker`

- **Args**: `scope: {input.scope}`
- **Output**: `{audit-report-N}` - Verification audit report
- **Depends on**: Step 3 completion

**Success criteria**: Checker completes validation.

**On failure**: Terminate workflow with status `fail`.

### 5. Iteration Control (Sequential)

Determine whether to continue fixing or terminate.

**Logic**:

- Count ALL findings in `{step4.outputs.audit-report-N}` (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM)
- If findings = 0 AND iterations >= min-iterations (or min not provided): Proceed to step 6 (Success)
- If findings = 0 AND iterations < min-iterations: Loop back to step 3 (need more iterations)
- If findings > 0 AND max-iterations provided AND iterations >= max-iterations: Proceed to step 6 (Partial)
- If findings > 0 AND (max-iterations not provided OR iterations < max-iterations): Loop back to step 3

**Depends on**: Step 4 completion

**Notes**:

- **Default behavior**: Runs indefinitely until zero findings (no max-iterations limit)
- **Optional min-iterations**: Prevents premature termination before sufficient iterations
- **Optional max-iterations**: Prevents infinite loops when explicitly provided
- Each iteration uses the latest audit report
- Tracks iteration count for observability

### 6. Finalization (Sequential)

Report final status and summary.

**Output**: `{final-status}`, `{iterations-completed}`, `{final-report}`

**Status determination**:

- **Success** (`pass`): Zero findings after validation
- **Partial** (`partial`): Findings remain after max-iterations
- **Failure** (`fail`): Technical errors during check or fix

**Depends on**: Reaching this step from step 2, 4, or 5

## Termination Criteria

- PASS: **Success** (`pass`): Zero findings of ANY level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM) in final validation
- **Partial** (`partial`): Any findings remain after max-iterations cycles
- FAIL: **Failure** (`fail`): Checker or fixer encountered technical errors

## Example Usage

### Validate All Explicit Relationships

```
User: "Run docs software engineering separation quality gate workflow for all in manual mode"
```

The AI will execute the workflow directly:

- Validate all explicit relationships (Java, Golang, Elixir, Spring, Spring Boot)
- Apply separation fixes
- Iterate until zero findings achieved

### Validate Specific Language

```
User: "Run docs software engineering separation quality gate workflow for programming-languages/java in manual mode"
```

The AI will execute with scoped validation:

- Validate only Java documentation separation
- Fix issues in Java docs only
- Iterate until zero findings in scope

### Validate Specific Framework

```
User: "Run docs software engineering separation quality gate workflow for platform-web/tools/jvm-spring-boot in manual mode"
```

The AI will execute with framework scope:

- Validate only Spring Boot documentation separation
- Fix issues in Spring Boot docs
- Iterate until clean

### With Iteration Bounds

```
User: "Run docs software engineering separation quality gate workflow with min-iterations=2 and max-iterations=10"
```

The AI will execute with iteration controls:

- Require at least 2 check-fix cycles
- Cap at maximum 10 iterations
- Report final status after completion

## Iteration Example

Typical execution flow:

```
Iteration 1:
  Check → 8 findings (missing prerequisites, duplicated content) → Fix → Re-check → 3 findings

Iteration 2:
  Check (reuse) → 3 findings (style guide lacks OSE Platform context) → Fix → Re-check → 0 findings

Result: SUCCESS (2 iterations)
```

## Safety Features

**Infinite Loop Prevention**:

- Optional max-iterations parameter (no default - runs until zero findings)
- When provided, workflow terminates with `partial` if limit reached
- Tracks iteration count for monitoring
- Use max-iterations when fix convergence is uncertain

**False Positive Protection**:

- Fixer re-validates each finding before applying
- Skips FALSE_POSITIVE findings automatically
- Progressive writing ensures audit history survives

**Error Recovery**:

- Continues to verification even if some fixes fail
- Reports which fixes succeeded/failed
- Generates final report regardless of status

## Validation Focus

The docs-software-engineering-separation-checker validates:

- **No Duplication**: docs/explanation MUST NOT duplicate AyoKoding educational content
- **Prerequisite Statements**: docs/explanation READMEs MUST reference AyoKoding learning paths
- **Style Guide Focus**: docs/explanation MUST focus on repository-specific conventions only
- **Learning Path Completeness**: AyoKoding MUST have required content (by-example, in-the-field)
- **Cross-Reference Links**: Links between platforms MUST be correct and functional

## Related Workflows

This workflow can be composed with:

- Content creation workflows (validate after creating style guides or tutorials)
- Release workflows (validate before version bump)
- Repository rules validation (comprehensive quality gate)

## Success Metrics

Track across executions:

- **Average iterations to completion**: How many cycles typically needed
- **Success rate**: Percentage reaching zero findings
- **Common finding categories**: What violations appear most often
- **Fix success rate**: Percentage of fixes applied without errors

## Notes

- **Fully automated**: No human checkpoints, runs to completion
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times, won't break working state
- **Conservative**: Fixer skips uncertain changes (preserves correctness)
- **Observable**: Generates audit reports for every iteration
- **Bounded**: Max-iterations prevents runaway execution
- **Scope-aware**: Validates only explicit relationships in prerequisite table
- **Incremental**: Enables gradual migration of content to separation model

This workflow ensures documentation separation compliance through iterative validation and fixing, supporting the transition from duplicated content to a clean separation between educational (AyoKoding) and style guide (docs/explanation) content.
