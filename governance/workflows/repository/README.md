# Repository Workflows

Orchestrated workflows for validating repository-level operations across principles, conventions, development practices, and agents.

## Purpose

These workflows define **WHEN and HOW to validate repository rules**, orchestrating repo-governance-checker and repo-governance-fixer agents to ensure consistency across all governance layers (principles, conventions, development practices, agents).

## Scope

**✅ Workflows Here:**

- Repository-wide consistency validation
- Cross-layer governance checking
- Agent standards enforcement
- Iterative check-fix-verify cycles

**❌ Not Included:**

- Content quality validation (that's docs/)
- Hugo content validation (that's ayokoding-web/)
- Plan validation (that's plan/)

## Workflows

- [Repository Rules Validation](./repository-rules-validation.md) - Validate repository consistency across all layers (principles, conventions, development, agents) and apply fixes iteratively until ZERO findings. Supports four strictness modes (lax, normal, strict, ocd)
