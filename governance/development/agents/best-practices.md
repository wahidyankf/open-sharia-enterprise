This document outlines best practices for developing AI agents in the `.claude/agents/` directory. Following these practices ensures agents are maintainable, secure, and effective at automating repository tasks.

## Purpose

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This companion document respects:

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)**: Provides practical examples of simple vs complex approaches
- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Makes patterns and anti-patterns explicit through clear examples

## Conventions Implemented/Respected

This companion document supports the conventions in this directory by providing practical examples and guidance.

Provide actionable guidance for:

- Agent design and architecture
- Tool permission management
- Model selection
- Testing and validation
- Documentation standards

## Best Practices

### Practice 1: Single Responsibility Per Agent

**Principle**: Each agent should have one clear, focused purpose.

**Good Example:**

```yaml
---
name: docs-checker
description: Validates factual correctness of documentation
tools: [Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch, Write, Bash]
model: sonnet
---
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
---
name: super-agent
description: Checks docs, writes content, deploys apps, manages files
tools: [*]  # Too many responsibilities
---
```

**Rationale:**

- Easier to test and debug
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Reusable across different workflows
- Simpler tool permission model

### Practice 2: Request Minimum Necessary Tool Permissions

**Principle**: Only request tools the agent actually needs.

**Good Example:**

```yaml
---
name: readme-checker
description: Validates README quality standards
tools: [Read, Glob, Grep, Write] # Only what is needed
---
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
---
name: readme-checker
description: Validates README quality standards
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, WebFetch, WebSearch] # Excessive
---
```

**Rationale:**

- Reduces security risk
- Clear what the agent can do
- Faster user approval
- Easier auditing

### Practice 3: Use Appropriate Model for Task Complexity

**Principle**: Match model to task complexity - use Haiku for simple tasks, Sonnet for complex reasoning.

**Good Example:**

```yaml
# Simple validation task
---
name: link-checker
model: haiku
---
# Complex reasoning task
---
name: plan-maker
model: sonnet
---
```

**Rationale:**

- Cost optimization
- Performance optimization
- Clear expectations

### Practice 4: Provide Clear, Actionable Descriptions

**Principle**: Agent description should clearly state WHAT the agent does and WHEN to use it.

**Good Example:**

```yaml
---
description: >
  Validates tutorial quality focusing on pedagogical structure,
  narrative flow, visual completeness, and hands-on elements.
  Use when reviewing tutorial documentation.
---
```

**Bad Example:**

```yaml
---
description: Checks stuff
---
```

**Rationale:**

- Users know when to invoke agent
- Clear purpose and scope
- Better discoverability

### Practice 5: Document Tool Usage in Agent Body

**Principle**: Explain HOW the agent uses its tools in the agent body content.

**Good Example:**

```markdown
## Tool Usage

- **Read/Glob/Grep**: Scan documentation files for validation
- **WebFetch/WebSearch**: Verify external references and links
- **Write**: Generate audit reports in generated-reports/
- **Bash**: Execute git commands for file operations
```

**Rationale:**

- Transparent behavior
- Easier troubleshooting
- Clear security model

### Practice 6: Use Bash Tools for .claude/ Operations

**Principle**: When creating/modifying files in `.claude/` directory, use Bash tools (heredoc, sed) instead of Write/Edit to avoid approval prompts.

**Good Example:**

```bash
cat > .claude/agents/new-agent.md <<'EOF'
---
name: new-agent
---
Content here
EOF
```

**Bad Example:**

```markdown
Use Write tool to create .claude/agents/new-agent.md

# This triggers user approval prompt!
```

**Rationale:**

- Enables autonomous operation
- Reduces friction
- Follows established patterns

### Practice 7: Test Agents with Edge Cases

**Principle**: Test agents with both valid and invalid inputs before deployment.

**Good Example:**

```markdown
## Test Scenarios

1. Valid markdown file - should pass
2. File with broken links - should report errors
3. Empty file - should handle gracefully
4. Non-existent file - should report error
5. Very large file - should handle pagination
```

**Rationale:**

- Robust error handling
- Graceful degradation
- Production readiness

### Practice 8: Provide Context in Agent Frontmatter

**Principle**: Include enough context in frontmatter for the agent to work autonomously.

**Good Example:**

```yaml
---
context: |
  This agent validates tutorial documentation following Diátaxis framework.
  Tutorials are learning-oriented, hands-on, and beginner-friendly.
  Reports written to generated-reports/ with UUID chains.
---
```

**Rationale:**

- Self-contained agents
- Reduced need for external documentation
- Consistent behavior

### Practice 9: Follow Naming Conventions

**Principle**: Use descriptive kebab-case names following agent naming patterns.

**Good Example:**

```
docs-checker.md
apps__ayokoding-web__general-maker.md
plan-executor.md
```

**Bad Example:**

```
checker.md
app1.md
my_agent.md
```

**Rationale:**

- Clear categorization
- Easy discovery
- Consistent organization

### Practice 10: Document Agent Dependencies

**Principle**: Clearly document what files, tools, or external services the agent depends on.

**Good Example:**

```yaml
---
dependencies:
  - generated-reports/ directory must exist
  - WebSearch tool requires US region
  - Expects Diátaxis framework structure
---
```

**Rationale:**

- Clear requirements
- Easier troubleshooting
- Better onboarding
