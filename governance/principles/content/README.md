# Content Principles

Content-specific foundational principles governing documentation, education, and communication.

## Purpose

These principles define **WHY we value specific approaches to content creation**, covering documentation writing, teaching methodologies, and knowledge sharing. All content conventions implement these principles.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Foundational values about content accessibility
- Philosophical stances on documentation importance
- Beliefs about learning and education
- Reasons behind content quality standards

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Specific formatting rules (that's a convention)
- How-to instructions for writing (that's a guide)
- Technical documentation standards (that's a convention)

## Principles Implemented/Respected

- [Accessibility First](./accessibility-first.md) - Design for universal access from the start (WCAG compliance, color-blind friendly palettes, alt text, screen reader support)
- [Documentation First](./documentation-first.md) - Documentation is mandatory, not optional. Every system, convention, feature, and decision must be documented
- [No Time Estimates](./no-time-estimates.md) - People work and learn at vastly different speeds. Focus on outcomes and deliverables, not arbitrary time constraints
- [Progressive Disclosure](./progressive-disclosure.md) - Start simple and layer complexity gradually. Beginners see simple patterns, experts access advanced features when needed
