# No Time Estimates

People work and learn at **vastly different speeds**. Focus on **outcomes and deliverables**, not arbitrary time constraints. Time estimates create pressure, anxiety, and artificial deadlines that harm learning and productivity.

## 🌟 Vision Supported

This principle serves the [Open Sharia Enterprise Vision](../../vision/ex-vi__open-sharia-enterprise.md) of making Islamic enterprise accessible to developers, businesses, and individuals working at their own pace worldwide.

**How this principle serves the vision:**

- **Respects Individual Context**: Developers in different timezones, with different work schedules, and different life circumstances can contribute meaningfully. No one excluded because they can't work "fast enough"
- **Encourages Thorough Learning**: Learners can master Islamic finance principles deeply without artificial pressure. Quality understanding over speed produces better Shariah-compliant implementations
- **Reduces Anxiety**: Removing time pressure makes the community welcoming. Developers focus on building halal enterprise correctly, not quickly
- **Sustainable Contribution**: Open-source thrives on consistent contribution over time, not sprints. Respecting pace enables long-term, sustainable participation
- **Global Inclusivity**: Not everyone has 40-hour workweeks or fast internet. No time estimates means no one left behind due to circumstances

**Vision alignment**: Democratization means meeting people where they are - in skill, time, and pace. Time estimates create artificial barriers that contradict the vision of universal accessibility.

## 🎯 What

**No Time Estimates** means:

- No "X hours to complete" in tutorials
- No "takes 30 minutes" in documentation
- No "2-3 weeks" in learning materials
- Focus on WHAT you'll achieve, not HOW LONG it takes
- Outcomes-based language

**Time-Based Framing** means:

- "This tutorial takes 2 hours"
- "Complete in 30 minutes"
- "Estimated time: 45 min"
- Focus on duration over outcomes
- Creates artificial pressure

## 💡 Why

### Benefits of Outcome Focus

1. **No Pressure**: Learn at your own pace without anxiety
2. **Inclusive**: Accommodates different learning speeds
3. **Accurate Expectations**: Focus on skills gained, not time spent
4. **Evergreen Content**: No need to update time estimates
5. **Intrinsic Motivation**: Learn for mastery, not to "finish on time"

### Problems with Time Estimates

1. **Creates Pressure**: "I should be done by now" anxiety
2. **Inaccurate**: Beginners take 10x longer than experts
3. **Discourages Deep Learning**: Rushing to meet time target
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Time estimates become outdated
5. **False Precision**: "2 hours" is meaningless without context

### Individual Variation in Learning Speed

**Same tutorial, different speeds**:

- Expert programmer: 20 minutes
- Experienced developer: 1 hour
- Junior developer: 3 hours
- Career changer: 8 hours
- Complete beginner: 2 days

**All are valid**. Time estimates serve no one well.

## 📋 How It Applies

### Tutorial Content

**Context**: Educational documentation and learning materials.

✅ **Outcome-Focused (Correct)**:

```markdown
# React Quick Start

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Create React components
- Manage state with hooks
- Handle user events
- Build a simple interactive app

Coverage: 5-30% of React fundamentals
```

**Why this works**: Describes WHAT you'll learn. No pressure. Clear outcomes.

❌ **Time-Based (Avoid)**:

```markdown
# React Quick Start

⏱️ Estimated time: 2-3 hours

This tutorial will teach you React basics in under 3 hours.
```

**Why this fails**: Creates anxiety if you take longer. Inaccurate for most learners.

### How-To Guides

**Context**: Problem-solving documentation.

✅ **Outcome-Focused (Correct)**:

```markdown
# How to Deploy to Production

This guide walks through production deployment steps:

1. Configure environment variables
2. Set up database
3. Deploy application
4. Verify deployment

You'll have a working production deployment by the end.
```

**Why this works**: Describes outcome (working deployment). No time pressure.

❌ **Time-Based (Avoid)**:

```markdown
# How to Deploy to Production

⏱️ Takes approximately 30-45 minutes

Quick 30-minute deployment guide.
```

**Why this fails**: 30 minutes for expert, 4 hours for beginner. Creates false expectations.

### Coverage Percentages (Allowed)

**Context**: Indicating tutorial depth.

✅ **Coverage Percentages (Correct)**:

```markdown
# Beginner Tutorial

Coverage: 0-60% of domain knowledge

Teaches fundamentals needed for 90% of real-world use cases.
```

**Why this works**: Indicates **depth/scope**, not duration. No time pressure.

**Important**: Coverage percentages describe **how much of the domain** you'll learn, not **how long it takes**.

### Project Planning (Exception)

**Context**: Project management documents in `plans/`.

✅ **Time Estimates Allowed (In Planning Context)**:

```markdown
# Project Plan

Implementation estimate: 2-3 weeks

Tasks:

- Database schema: 2 days
- API endpoints: 1 week
- Frontend: 1 week
```

**Why this is acceptable**: Project planning requires resource allocation. This is for team coordination, not learner pressure.

**Not applicable to**: Educational content, tutorials, documentation, how-to guides.

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns

### Tutorial Time Estimates

❌ **Problem**: Adding time estimates to educational content.

```markdown
# Python for Beginners

⏱️ Total time: 10 hours
📅 Suggested pace: 2 hours/day for 5 days

- Day 1 (2 hours): Variables and data types
- Day 2 (2 hours): Control flow
- Day 3 (2 hours): Functions
```

**Why it's bad**:

- Creates artificial daily schedule
- Pressures learners to "keep up"
- Ignores individual learning speeds
- Discourages deep understanding

### "Quick" or "In X Minutes" Titles

❌ **Problem**: Using time in titles.

```markdown
- "React in 30 Minutes"
- "Quick Python Tutorial (45 min)"
- "Learn Go in 2 Hours"
```

**Why it's bad**:

- Clickbait-style titles
- False advertising (beginners take much longer)
- Creates pressure to rush
- Undermines quality learning

### Speed as a Selling Point

❌ **Problem**: Emphasizing speed over mastery.

```markdown
Learn React FAST! Complete this bootcamp in just 2 weeks!

🚀 Rapid learning path
⚡ Fast-track to employment
```

**Why it's bad**:

- Quality learning takes time
- Creates unrealistic expectations
- Discourages beginners who need more time
- Promotes shallow understanding

### Comparing Learning Speeds

❌ **Problem**: Suggesting "normal" learning speeds.

```markdown
Most people complete this tutorial in 3-4 hours.
```

**Why it's bad**:

- Implies those taking longer are "slow"
- Creates anxiety and discouragement
- No basis for "most people" claim
- Unhelpful and harmful

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Describe Outcomes, Not Duration

**Focus on what learners will achieve**:

```markdown
✅ By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Build REST APIs with Express
- Implement authentication
- Connect to databases
- Deploy to production

❌ This tutorial takes 4-6 hours
```

### 2. Use Coverage Percentages for Depth

**Indicate scope, not time**:

```markdown
✅ Coverage: 60-85% of domain knowledge (intermediate depth)

This tutorial covers professional-level techniques for production
systems. Builds on beginner foundation.

❌ This is a 3-week intermediate course
```

### 3. Provide Completion Criteria

**Describe how learners know they're done**:

```markdown
✅ You've completed this tutorial when you can:

- [ ] Create components independently
- [ ] Debug React applications
- [ ] Build a working app from scratch

❌ You should finish this in 2-3 days
```

### 4. Use Section Headings, Not Time Blocks

**Organize by topic, not duration**:

```markdown
✅ ## Core Concepts

- Variables and types
- Control flow
- Functions

❌ ## Day 1 (2 hours)

- Variables and types
- Control flow
```

### 5. Emphasize Mastery Over Speed

**Value understanding, not completion time**:

```markdown
✅ Take your time to understand each concept. Experiment with the
code examples. Learning thoroughly now saves time debugging later.

❌ Try to complete each section in 30 minutes to stay on track.
```
