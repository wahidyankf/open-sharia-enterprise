# Simplicity Over Complexity

Favor **minimum viable abstraction** and avoid over-engineering. Start simple and add complexity **only when proven necessary** through actual use and pain points.

## Vision Supported

This principle serves the [Open Sharia Enterprise Vision](../../vision/open-sharia-enterprise.md) of democratizing Shariah-compliant enterprise by lowering barriers to entry for developers worldwide.

**How this principle serves the vision:**

- **Accessible to All Skill Levels**: Simple code and flat structures mean junior developers can contribute, not just senior engineers. Lowers the knowledge barrier to building Islamic enterprise solutions
- **Faster Learning Curve**: Developers new to Islamic finance can understand implementations quickly without fighting unnecessary complexity. Speeds adoption and contribution
- **Easier Auditing**: Simple, direct code makes Shariah compliance easier to verify. Transparency through simplicity builds trust in halal enterprise solutions
- **Lower Maintenance Costs**: Simple systems require less expertise to maintain. Makes sustainable open-source Islamic enterprise viable for the long term
- **Focus on Islamic Finance Logic**: By avoiding technical over-engineering, developers spend time understanding Shariah principles, not wrestling with complex abstractions

**Vision alignment**: When building Shariah-compliant enterprise solutions is simple and straightforward, more developers will choose it. Simplicity democratizes access - both to building and to understanding Islamic business technology.

## What

**Simplicity** means:

- Minimum abstraction needed to solve the problem
- Direct, straightforward solutions
- Flat structures over deep hierarchies
- Single-purpose components
- Easy to understand and modify

**Complexity** means:

- Premature abstraction "for future flexibility"
- Over-engineered frameworks and layers
- Deep nesting and indirection
- Multi-purpose components doing too much
- Requires study to understand

## Why

### Benefits of Simplicity

1. **Understandability**: Anyone can read and comprehend the code/structure
2. **Maintainability**: Changes are easy to make without breaking things
3. **Debuggability**: Problems are easy to trace and fix
4. **Onboarding**: New team members become productive faster
5. **Flexibility**: Simple systems are easier to refactor when needs change

### Problems with Premature Complexity

1. **Over-Engineering**: Building features nobody needs
2. **Cognitive Load**: Requires understanding unnecessary abstractions
3. **Maintenance Burden**: More code to maintain and test
4. **Wrong Abstractions**: Future needs differ from predictions
5. **Analysis Paralysis**: Spending time designing instead of building

### KISS and YAGNI Principles

- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Simple solutions are better than complex ones
- **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Don't build features until they're actually needed
- **Rule of Three**: Refactor to abstraction after third duplication, not first

## How It Applies

### Flat Library Structure

**Context**: Organizing libraries in `libs/` directory.

PASS: **Simple (Correct)**:

```
libs/
├── ts-validation/
├── ts-auth/
├── ts-database/
└── ts-api-client/
```

**Why this works**: Flat structure. Easy to find libraries. No mental model of hierarchy needed.

FAIL: **Complex (Avoid)**:

```
libs/
├── shared/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── validation/
│   │   └── auth/
│   └── utils/
│       ├── database/
│       └── api/
└── features/
    └── user/
        └── data-access/
```

**Why this fails**: Deep nesting. Requires understanding the categorization scheme. Hard to find things. Premature organization.

### Single-Purpose AI Agents

**Context**: Agent responsibilities.

PASS: **Simple (Correct)**:

```
docs-maker.md - Creates documentation
docs-checker.md - Validates documentation
```

**Why this works**: One agent, one job. Clear responsibility. Easy to invoke.

FAIL: **Complex (Avoid)**:

```
docs-manager.md - Creates, validates, fixes, organizes, and links documentation
```

**Why this fails**: Multi-purpose agent. Hard to predict behavior. Unclear when to use.

### Minimal Frontmatter

**Context**: Document metadata.

PASS: **Simple (Correct)**:

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
description: Brief description
category: explanation
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
created: 2025-12-15
updated: 2025-12-15
---
```

**Why this works**: Only essential fields. No unnecessary metadata. Self-explanatory.

FAIL: **Complex (Avoid)**:

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
subtitle: Additional subtitle
description: Brief description
long_description: Very long description
category: explanation
subcategory: principles
sub_subcategory: philosophy
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
keywords: [word1, word2, word3]
author: Name
contributors: [Name1, Name2]
version: 1.0.0
status: published
priority: high
visibility: public
license: MIT
created: 2025-12-15

reviewed: 2025-12-15
approved: 2025-12-15
next_review: 2026-01-15
---
```

**Why this fails**: Too many fields. Most are unused. Maintenance burden. Analysis paralysis deciding which fields to fill.

### Direct Markdown Over Templating

**Context**: Documentation format.

PASS: **Simple (Correct)**:

```markdown
# Document Title

## Section

Content here...
```

**Why this works**: Standard markdown. Works everywhere. Easy to write and read.

FAIL: **Complex (Avoid)**:

```
{{< section title="Section" >}}
  {{< content type="text" >}}
    Content here...
  {{< /content >}}
{{< /section >}}
```

**Why this fails**: Custom templating syntax. Requires learning. Not portable. Over-engineered.

### Convention Documents Over Frameworks

**Context**: Establishing standards.

PASS: **Simple (Correct)**:

```
governance/conventions/
  ex-co__file-naming-convention.md
  ex-co__linking-convention.md
```

**Why this works**: Markdown documents. Searchable. Easy to update. Human-readable.

FAIL: **Complex (Avoid)**:

```
.conventions/
  schema.json
  rules.yaml
  validators/
    file-naming.ts
    linking.ts
  generators/
    scaffold.ts
```

**Why this fails**: Over-engineered framework. Requires tooling. Harder to understand and modify. Building a system before validating need.

## Anti-Patterns

### Premature Abstraction

FAIL: **Problem**: Creating abstraction before third use.

```typescript
// First use - just write the code directly
function createUser(name: string) {
  return { name, createdAt: new Date() };
}

// FAIL: WRONG: Immediately abstracting
class EntityFactory<T> {
  create(data: Partial<T>): T {
    return {
      ...data,
      createdAt: new Date(),
    } as T;
  }
}
```

**Why it's bad**: Abstraction before proven need. YAGNI violation. Wait for third duplication.

### Configuration Explosion

FAIL: **Problem**: Too many configuration options.

```json
{
  "feature": {
    "enabled": true,
    "mode": "advanced",
    "submode": "experimental",
    "options": {
      "option1": true,
      "option2": false,
      "option3": {
        "suboption1": "value",
        "suboption2": 42
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Why it's bad**: Combinatorial explosion. Most combinations never used. Impossible to test.

### Deep Inheritance Hierarchies

FAIL: **Problem**: Multi-level inheritance.

```typescript
class Entity {}
class User extends Entity {}
class AuthenticatedUser extends User {}
class PremiumUser extends AuthenticatedUser {}
class AdminUser extends PremiumUser {}
```

**Why it's bad**: Fragile base class. Changes ripple through hierarchy. Hard to understand behavior.

### Over-Generic Code

FAIL: **Problem**: Solving problems you don't have.

```typescript
class GenericRepository<T, K extends keyof T, V extends T[K]> {
  find(key: K, value: V): T | undefined {
    // Complex generic implementation
  }
}
```

**Why it's bad**: Generic for genericity's sake. Harder to read. Probably simpler to write specific implementations.

## PASS: Best Practices

### 1. Start Concrete, Abstract Later

**First implementation** - write it directly:

```typescript
// First function - concrete implementation
function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
  return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
}
```

**After third duplication** - extract pattern:

```typescript
// Third similar function - now abstract
function validateFormat(value: string, pattern: RegExp): boolean {
  return pattern.test(value);
}

function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {
  return validateFormat(email, /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/);
}
```

### 2. Prefer Composition Over Inheritance

**Instead of inheritance**:

```typescript
FAIL: class AdminUser extends PremiumUser {}
```

**Use composition**:

```typescript
PASS: interface User {
  name: string;
  roles: Role[];
  subscription: Subscription;
}
```

### 3. Flat Over Nested

**For file structure, data, and organization**:

```
PASS: Flat:
libs/
  ts-validation/
  ts-auth/

FAIL: Nested:
libs/
  shared/
    core/
      validation/
```

### 4. One Job Per Component

**Single-purpose functions/agents**:

```typescript
PASS: function validateEmail(email: string): boolean {}
PASS: function sendEmail(to: string, subject: string): void {}

FAIL: function handleEmail(email: string, action: string): any {}
```

### 5. Wait for Pain Before Refactoring

**Don't refactor speculatively**:

- FAIL: "We might need this to be configurable someday"
- FAIL: "What if we need to support multiple databases?"
- PASS: "We're duplicating this in three places - time to abstract"
- PASS: "This function has 200 lines - time to split it"

## Examples from This Repository

### Monorepo Structure

**Location**: Root project structure

```
apps/          # Flat app directory
libs/          # Flat lib directory
docs/          # Flat category directories
  tutorials/
  how-to/
  reference/
  explanation/
```

**Simplicity features**:

- PASS: Two-level maximum depth
- PASS: Clear categorization
- PASS: Easy to navigate
- PASS: No premature organization

### Agent Responsibilities

**Location**: `.opencode/agent/`

Each agent has **one clear job**:

- `docs-maker.md` - Creates documentation
- `docs-checker.md` - Validates documentation
- `docs-link-general-checker.md` - Checks links
- `plan-maker.md` - Creates plans
- `plan-executor.md` - Executes plans

**Not**:

- FAIL: `docs-manager.md` - Does everything
- FAIL: `universal-agent.md` - Multi-purpose

### Diátaxis Framework

**Location**: Documentation organization

Four simple categories:

- **Tutorials** - Learning-oriented
- **How-To** - Problem-solving
- **Reference** - Information lookup
- **Explanation** - Understanding concepts

**Not**:

- FAIL: 15 categories with overlapping purposes
- FAIL: Complex taxonomy requiring study

### Convention Documents

**Location**: `governance/conventions/`

Simple markdown documents:

```
ex-co__file-naming-convention.md
ex-co__linking-convention.md
ex-co__color-accessibility.md
```

**Not**:

- FAIL: JSON schemas with validators
- FAIL: Custom DSL for conventions
- FAIL: Code generation framework

## Implementation Guidelines

### Minimum Code, Maximum Clarity

Write the minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

**Core Rules:**

1. **No features beyond what was asked**
   - Don't add "nice to have" functionality
   - Don't anticipate future requirements
   - Don't build flexibility that wasn't requested

2. **No abstractions for single-use code**
   - Three similar lines are better than premature abstraction
   - Don't create helpers for one-time operations
   - Don't design for hypothetical reuse

3. **No unnecessary configurability**
   - Don't add configuration options that weren't requested
   - Hard-code when appropriate
   - Avoid feature flags for non-existent use cases

4. **No error handling for impossible scenarios**
   - Trust internal code and framework guarantees
   - Only validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
   - Don't add defensive code for scenarios that can't happen

5. **Length as a smell**
   - If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it
   - More code = more bugs, more maintenance
   - Brevity is a virtue when clarity is maintained

### The Senior Engineer Test

**Ask yourself**: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?"

If yes, simplify. Keep asking until the answer is no.

**Warning signs of over-engineering:**

- Helper functions used once
- Configuration for scenarios that don't exist
- Abstractions that obscure rather than clarify
- Error handling for impossible conditions
- "Flexibility" that adds complexity without clear benefit
- Code doing more than requested

## Application Examples

### Example 1: Feature Request - "Add a dark mode toggle"

**FAIL: Over-engineered**:

```typescript
// 200+ lines with theme system, configuration, persistence, animation...
interface ThemeConfig {
  mode: "light" | "dark" | "auto";
  customColors?: ColorPalette;
  transitionDuration?: number;
  persistenceStrategy?: "localStorage" | "cookie" | "api";
}

class ThemeManager {
  // Complex abstraction for a simple boolean toggle
}
```

**PASS: Minimal solution**:

```typescript
// 20 lines - just what was asked
const [isDark, setIsDark] = useState(false);

return (
  <button onClick={() => setIsDark(!isDark)}>
    Toggle {isDark ? 'Light' : 'Dark'} Mode
  </button>
);
```

### Example 2: API Error Handling

**FAIL: Defensive for impossible scenarios**:

```typescript
async function getUser(id: string) {
  if (!id) throw new Error("ID required"); // ID is required by type system
  if (typeof id !== "string") throw new Error("ID must be string"); // TypeScript guarantees this
  if (id.length === 0) throw new Error("ID cannot be empty"); // Already checked above

  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
    if (!response) throw new Error("No response"); // Fetch never returns undefined
    if (!response.data) throw new Error("No data"); // API contract guarantees data
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Complex retry logic, fallbacks, logging that wasn't requested
  }
}
```

**PASS: Validate at boundaries only**:

```typescript
async function getUser(id: string) {
  // Trust internal code - TypeScript and API contract guarantee correctness
  const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
  return response.data;

  // Handle errors at system boundary (API call)
  // Let framework handle network errors
}
```

### Example 3: Utility Functions

**FAIL: Premature abstraction**:

```typescript
// Created utility for one use case
function formatUserDisplay(user: User, options?: DisplayOptions): string {
  const { includeEmail, includeRole, separator = " - " } = options || {};
  const parts = [user.name];
  if (includeEmail) parts.push(user.email);
  if (includeRole) parts.push(user.role);
  return parts.join(separator);
}

// Used once
const display = formatUserDisplay(user, { includeEmail: true });
```

**PASS: Inline for single use**:

```typescript
// Just write it inline
const display = `${user.name} - ${user.email}`;

// If needed multiple times later, THEN extract
```

## Relationship to Other Principles

- **[Deliberate Problem-Solving](../software-engineering/deliberate-problem-solving.md)**: Suggesting simpler approaches is part of deliberate problem-solving
- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Simple code is often more explicit than complex abstractions
- **[Automation Over Manual](../software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)**: Automate what's repetitive, but don't over-engineer the automation
- **[Progressive Disclosure](../content/progressive-disclosure.md)**: Start simple, layer complexity only when proven necessary

## For AI Agents

All agents must follow this principle by:

1. **Only implementing what was requested** - no speculative features
2. **Avoiding premature abstractions** - inline first, extract when needed
3. **Trusting type systems and frameworks** - no defensive code for guaranteed scenarios
4. **Applying the senior engineer test** - questioning complexity proactively
5. **Preferring boring solutions** - battle-tested patterns over clever code

See the "Principles Respected" section in [AI Agents Convention](../../development/agents/ai-agents.md#principles-respected) for how agents apply this principle.

## Common Violations

### Violation 1: Anticipating Future Requirements

```
FAIL: "I'll make this configurable in case you need different behavior later"
PASS: "Here's the solution for your current requirement. We can make it configurable if needed."
```

### Violation 2: Creating Abstractions Prematurely

```
FAIL: [Creates BaseRepository class and generic CRUD utilities for one model]
PASS: [Writes direct database calls. Extracts patterns after third similar implementation]
```

### Violation 3: Defensive Programming for Type-Safe Code

```
FAIL: if (typeof user.id === 'number') { ... } // TypeScript already guarantees this
PASS: const userId = user.id; // Trust the type system
```

## Summary

Simplicity Over Complexity means:

- **Minimal** code that solves the current problem
- **No speculation** about future requirements
- **Trust** type systems and framework guarantees
- **Inline** first, abstract when patterns emerge
- **Question** complexity at every step

The right amount of complexity is the **minimum needed** for the current task.
