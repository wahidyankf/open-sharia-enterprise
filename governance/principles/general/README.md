# General Principles

Universal foundational principles that apply to all problem-solving contexts - beyond software, content, or any specific domain.

## Purpose

These principles define **WHY we value fundamental approaches** that transcend specific domains. They apply universally to all work in this repository, from software development to documentation writing to process design.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Universal values applicable across all domains
- Foundational beliefs about problem-solving
- Cross-cutting philosophical stances
- Timeless principles guiding all decisions

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Domain-specific principles (software engineering, content)
- Specific implementation rules (that's a convention)
- How-to solve particular problems (that's a guide)

## Principles Implemented/Respected

- [Deliberate Problem-Solving](./deliberate-problem-solving.md) - Think before coding - surface assumptions, tradeoffs, and confusion rather than hiding them
- [Simplicity Over Complexity](./simplicity-over-complexity.md) - Favor minimum viable abstraction and avoid over-engineering. Start simple and add complexity only when proven necessary
