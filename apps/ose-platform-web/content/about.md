# About Open Sharia Enterprise

Open Sharia Enterprise (OSE) Platform is an **open-source** platform for building Sharia-compliant enterprise solutions. Built for Islamic finance institutions and Sharia-compliant businesses, starting with Indonesian regulations and expanding globally.

## The Opportunity

Islamic finance is a multi-trillion dollar industry growing at double-digit rates, creating massive demand for Sharia-compliant enterprise systems. While purpose-built platforms exist, they're typically proprietary and expensive. Many organizations still struggle with legacy systems retrofitted for Sharia compliance.

**The gap?** Accessible, open-source solutions with built-in compliance and radical transparency.

## Mission

Our mission is to democratize access to **trustworthy**, Sharia-compliant enterprise technology for organizations of all sizes, regardless of region or industry.

We're building an open-source platform with Sharia-compliance at its core—starting with Indonesian regulations and ERP foundations, expanding across enterprise domains (finance, commerce, cooperatives) and global markets.

## Why Open Source Matters

**Transparency builds trust in Sharia-compliant systems.** Unlike expensive proprietary solutions, OSE Platform is accessible to all organizations—from small businesses to large enterprises.

### Trust Through Transparency

- **Community verification** - Anyone can review the code to verify Sharia compliance
- **Auditable by scholars** - Islamic finance experts can examine implementation details
- **No hidden mechanisms** - Complete transparency in financial calculations and processes
- **Trust through openness** - Open standards and shared knowledge drive innovation

### Accessible to All

- **No licensing fees** - Free to use, modify, and deploy for any organization
- **No vendor lock-in** - Own your data, control your infrastructure
- **Community-driven** - Benefits from collective expertise and contributions
- **Lower barriers** - Organizations of all sizes can access enterprise-grade solutions

### Open Standards

- **Interoperability** - Works with existing systems through open standards
- **Portable** - Not tied to specific vendors or proprietary formats
- **Extensible** - Customize for your organization's specific needs
- **Future-proof** - Community ensures long-term sustainability

## Development Approach

We're building OSE Platform **in the open from day one**, with transparency and knowledge-sharing as core principles.

### Built in the Open

- **Public development** - All code, discussions, and decisions happen publicly on GitHub
- **Security and compliance infrastructure developed in parallel** - Not bolted on later
- **Community-driven roadmap** - Transparent planning and prioritization
- **Open governance** - Clear decision-making processes and contribution guidelines

### Learning in Public

We document our journey and share knowledge through [**AyoKoding**](https://ayokoding.com), our bilingual educational platform. This "learning in public" approach:

- **Shares technical insights** - Tutorials, guides, and lessons learned
- **Builds community expertise** - Help others learn from our experiences
- **Demonstrates transparency** - Show how decisions are made
- **Accelerates ecosystem growth** - Enable others to build on our foundation

### Current Status

**Phase 0: Research and Setup** - We're establishing foundations before building features:

- Infrastructure, documentation framework, and planning systems
- Research into Indonesian regulations (OJK, DSN-MUI, PBI, PDP)
- Security and DevSecOps foundations
- AI/ML exploration and integration research

⚠️ **Pre-Alpha** - Not yet production ready. No stable APIs, no security hardening, not accepting contributions yet.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 0: Setup and Research

Establishing the foundational infrastructure and conducting research:

- 🛠️ **Development Tooling & Processes** - Infrastructure, documentation framework, AI agents, planning system
- 🏗️ **Architecture & Design** - Monorepo architecture, core patterns, technology evaluation, security foundations
- 🤖 **AI Research** - AI/ML applications, LLM integration, intelligent automation
- 🔍 **Sharia Compliance Research** - Indonesian regulations (OJK, DSN-MUI, PBI, PDP)
- 🛡️ **Security & DevSecOps Research** - Information security frameworks, threat modeling, compliance as code
- ☁️ **Infrastructure Creation** - Cloud infrastructure, deployment pipelines, CI/CD setup

### Phase 1: ERP Foundation

Building a solid enterprise foundation with ERP capabilities:

- 💰 **Financial Management** - Accounting & finance, asset management, reporting & analytics with Sharia compliance
- 🔗 **Operations Management** - Supply chain (halal-compliant), inventory control, procurement & vendor management
- 👥 **People & Customer Management** - HR & payroll (Sharia-compliant), sales & CRM, customer relationships
- 🕌 **Execution & Compliance** - Project management, resource allocation, Sharia compliance framework

### Phase 2: Enterprise Domain Expansion

Expanding across enterprise domains with Indonesian regulatory alignment:

- 🏦 **Regulatory Compliance** - Indonesian Banking Authority (OJK) and National Sharia Board (DSN-MUI) integration
- 📚 **Financial Services Standards** - Indonesian best practices and implementation guidelines for banking, payments, and cooperatives
- 📈 **Market Monitoring** - Enterprise technology trends, regulatory changes, and market needs
- 💳 **Domain Implementation** - Financial services (payments, lending, banking), commerce, and cooperative management

### Phase 3: Global Expansion

Extending the platform to support multiple jurisdictions:

- 🕌 **International Islamic finance standards** - Accounting (AAOIFI) and prudential (IFSB) standards
- 🌏 **Multi-jurisdiction compliance** for various countries and regions
- 📖 **Regional variations** in Sharia interpretations and requirements
- ✈️ **Cross-border enterprise operations** support

## Why This Approach?

- 🔬 **Research before building** - Phase 0 establishes foundations through compliance, security, and AI research before implementation
- 🇮🇩 **Indonesian market first** - Deep focus on local regulations (OJK, DSN-MUI, PBI, PDP) before global expansion
- 🏗️ **ERP as foundation** - Enterprise Resource Planning provides core infrastructure for all business operations
- 🕌 **Sharia-compliance from day one** - Built-in compliance architecture, not bolt-on features
- 🛡️ **Security by design** - DevSecOps and compliance-as-code integrated from the start
- 📈 **Scalable architecture** - Standards-based design enables extension to new regions
- ⚖️ **Gradual expansion** - Phased approach reduces complexity while ensuring quality

## Core Principles

- 🕌 **Sharia-compliance as a foundation** - Built in from the ground up, not bolted on later
- 🔓 **Transparency and openness** - Code transparency builds trust
- 🌐 **Open source by default** - Radical transparency unless it compromises security/privacy
- 🤖 **AI-assisted development** - Leverage AI systematically to enhance productivity
- 🤝 **Community collaboration** - Accelerate development of accessible tools
- 🛡️ **Governance and security from day one** - Essential for enterprise solutions
