# About Open Sharia Enterprise

Open Sharia Enterprise (OSE) Platform is an **open-source** platform for building Sharia-compliant enterprise solutions. Built for Islamic finance institutions and Sharia-compliant businesses, starting with Indonesian regulations and expanding globally.

## The Opportunity

Islamic finance is a multi-trillion dollar industry growing at double-digit rates, creating massive demand for Sharia-compliant enterprise systems. While purpose-built platforms exist, they're typically proprietary and expensive. Many organizations still struggle with legacy systems retrofitted for Sharia compliance.

**The gap?** Accessible, open-source solutions with built-in compliance and radical transparency.

## Mission

Our mission is to democratize access to **trustworthy**, Sharia-compliant enterprise technology for organizations of all sizes, regardless of region or industry.

We're building an open-source platform with Sharia-compliance at its core—following a progressive complexity approach from individual users (Phase 1: Organic Lever productivity tracker) to SMB (Phase 2) to enterprise (Phase 3: full ERP and global expansion). Each phase generates revenue to fund the next, ensuring sustainable growth.

## Why Open Source Matters

**Transparency builds trust in Sharia-compliant systems.** Unlike expensive proprietary solutions, OSE Platform is accessible to all organizations—from small businesses to large enterprises.

### Trust Through Transparency

- **Community verification** - Anyone can review the code to verify Sharia compliance
- **Auditable by scholars** - Islamic finance experts can examine implementation details
- **No hidden mechanisms** - Complete transparency in financial calculations and processes
- **Trust through openness** - Open standards and shared knowledge drive innovation

### Accessible to All

- **No licensing fees** - Free to use, modify, and deploy for any organization
- **No vendor lock-in** - Own your data, control your infrastructure
- **Community-driven** - Benefits from collective expertise and contributions
- **Lower barriers** - Organizations of all sizes can access enterprise-grade solutions

### Open Standards

- **Interoperability** - Works with existing systems through open standards
- **Portable** - Not tied to specific vendors or proprietary formats
- **Extensible** - Customize for your organization's specific needs
- **Future-proof** - Community ensures long-term sustainability

## Development Approach

We're building OSE Platform **in the open from day one**, with transparency and knowledge-sharing as core principles.

### Built in the Open

- **Public development** - All code, discussions, and decisions happen publicly on GitHub
- **Security and compliance infrastructure developed in parallel** - Not bolted on later
- **Community-driven roadmap** - Transparent planning and prioritization
- **Open governance** - Clear decision-making processes and contribution guidelines

### Learning in Public

We document our journey and share knowledge through [**AyoKoding**](https://ayokoding.com), our bilingual educational platform. This "learning in public" approach:

- **Shares technical insights** - Tutorials, guides, and lessons learned
- **Builds community expertise** - Help others learn from our experiences
- **Demonstrates transparency** - Show how decisions are made
- **Accelerates ecosystem growth** - Enable others to build on our foundation

### Current Status

**Phase 0: Repository Setup & Knowledge Base** - Establishing foundations and launching initial websites:

- Repository infrastructure (development tooling, documentation, AI agents, governance)
- **ayokoding.com** - Educational platform sharing our research and learning
- **oseplatform.com** - Platform marketing website (this site!)
- **ayokoding-cli** & **rhino-cli** - Golang CLI tools for automation and repository management
- Golang foundation for information security infrastructure
- Building online presence before Phase 1 product launch

⚠️ **Pre-Alpha** - Not yet production ready. No stable APIs, no security hardening, not accepting contributions yet.

## Development Roadmap

Our progressive complexity approach - start simple, test thoroughly, scale systematically:

### Phase 0: Repository Setup & Knowledge Base (Current)

Establishing repository infrastructure and launching initial websites:

- 🛠️ **Repository Infrastructure** - Development tooling, documentation, AI agents, governance, planning systems
- 🌐 **Website Launches** - ayokoding.com (educational) and oseplatform.com (marketing)
- 🔧 **CLI Tools** - ayokoding-cli and rhino-cli (Golang) for automation and repository management
- 🔐 **Golang Foundation** - Golang will be used extensively on the information security side
- 📊 **Strategic Value** - Early online presence, audience building, deployment validation

### Phase 1: Organic Lever - Productivity Tracker (Individual Users)

First application release to test infrastructure at small scale:

- 📱 **Product** - organiclever.com (web) + Android + iOS apps
- ⚡ **Tech Stack** - Java + Spring Boot, Next.js + TypeScript, Flutter + Dart, Kubernetes
- 📚 **Learning Focus** - Small-scale knowledge base patterns, deployment mastery, security practice
- 💰 **Revenue Generation** - Fund Phase 2 expansion and Phase 3 certification costs

### Phase 2: SMB Application (Small & Medium Business)

Building on Phase 1 foundation with moderate complexity:

- 🏢 **Scope** - TBD based on Phase 1 learnings
- 🔧 **Tech** - Likely additions: Elixir middleware, Kotlin or F#, modular services architecture
- ☸️ **Infrastructure** - Building on Phase 1 Kubernetes experience for multi-service orchestration
- 💰 **Critical Revenue** - Must fund Phase 3's significant certification budget

### Phase 3: Enterprise Application (Large Organizations)

Full enterprise capabilities with maximum scale:

- 🌐 **Scope** - Full ERP, financial services, multi-jurisdiction compliance
- 🏗️ **Architecture** - Distributed microservices, event-driven, service mesh
- 📜 **Certifications** - Multi-jurisdiction compliance, Sharia certifications, financial regulations (funded by Phase 1/2 success)
- 🌏 **Global Expansion** - International Islamic standards, cross-border operations

## Why This Approach?

- 📈 **Progressive Complexity** - Start simple (individuals), scale to moderate (SMB), then enterprise
- 🧪 **Real-World Testing** - Each phase validates with actual users before scaling up
- 💰 **Financial Sustainability** - Phase 3 requires significant certifications; Phase 1/2 revenue funds this
- 📚 **Knowledge Base Learning** - Test patterns at small scale before enterprise ERP
- 🔄 **Learn and Iterate** - Feedback from retail informs SMB; SMB learnings inform enterprise
- 🎯 **Minimum Risk** - Organic Lever tests infrastructure without enterprise stakes
- 🛡️ **Security by Design** - Practice security early in low-stakes environment
- ⚖️ **Proven Foundation** - Each phase proves architecture works before adding complexity

## Core Principles

- 🕌 **Sharia-compliance as a foundation** - Built in from the ground up, not bolted on later
- 🔓 **Transparency and openness** - Code transparency builds trust
- 🌐 **Open source by default** - Radical transparency unless it compromises security/privacy
- 🤖 **AI-assisted development** - Leverage AI systematically to enhance productivity
- 🤝 **Community collaboration** - Accelerate development of accessible tools
- 🛡️ **Governance and security from day one** - Essential for enterprise solutions
