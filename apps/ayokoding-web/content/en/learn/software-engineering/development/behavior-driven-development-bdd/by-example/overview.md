**Want to master Behavior-Driven Development through practical examples?** This by-example guide teaches BDD through annotated code and scenario examples organized by complexity level.

## What Is BDD By-Example Learning?

BDD by-example learning is a **code-first approach** where you learn through practical implementations of BDD scenarios and frameworks rather than narrative explanations. Each example shows:

- **Gherkin scenarios** - Natural language specifications that stakeholders can read
- **Working code** - Runnable step definitions and test implementations
- **Framework integration** - How BDD fits into real testing workflows
- **Production patterns** - Proven approaches from industry leaders

This approach is **ideal for developers and testers** who want to implement effective collaboration through executable specifications.

## Learning Path

The BDD by-example tutorial guides you through examples organized into three progressive levels, from basic Gherkin syntax to enterprise-scale BDD implementations.

## Coverage Philosophy

This by-example guide provides practical coverage of BDD through annotated examples. The focus is on **implementing BDD workflows**, not just theory.

### What's Covered

- **Gherkin fundamentals** - Given-When-Then, scenarios, features, backgrounds
- **Step definitions** - Mapping natural language to executable code
- **Data-driven scenarios** - Scenario outlines, example tables, data tables
- **Framework integration** - Cucumber (Java/JavaScript), SpecFlow (.NET), Behave (Python)
- **Production patterns** - Page Object Model, API testing, database testing, CI/CD integration
- **Advanced BDD** - Microservices scenarios, event-driven BDD, living documentation

### What's NOT Covered

- Manual testing techniques (see testing fundamentals for manual approaches)
- Unit testing details (see TDD tutorial for unit testing focus)
- Framework-specific advanced features beyond common patterns

## Prerequisites

- Programming experience in at least one language (Java, JavaScript, Python, or C#)
- Basic understanding of automated testing concepts
- Familiarity with web applications and APIs

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent format:

1. **Brief Explanation**: What BDD concept the example demonstrates
2. **Gherkin Scenario**: Natural language specification
3. **Annotated Code**: Step definitions with inline comments
4. **Example Execution**: How the test runs and what it validates
5. **Key Takeaway**: The core BDD principle to retain

This structure provides specification, implementation, and understanding all in one place.
