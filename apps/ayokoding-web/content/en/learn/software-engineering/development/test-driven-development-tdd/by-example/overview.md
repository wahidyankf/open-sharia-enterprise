**Want to master Test-Driven Development through practical examples?** This by-example guide teaches TDD through annotated code examples organized by complexity level.

## What Is TDD By-Example Learning?

TDD by-example learning is a **code-first approach** where you learn through practical implementations of the Red-Green-Refactor cycle rather than narrative explanations. Each example shows:

- **Failing tests first** - Red phase demonstrating test-first thinking
- **Minimal implementation** - Green phase making tests pass with simplest code
- **Refactoring** - Improving design while keeping tests green
- **Production patterns** - Proven approaches from industry leaders

This approach is **ideal for developers** who want to master test-first development through hands-on practice.

## Learning Path

The TDD by-example tutorial guides you through examples organized into three progressive levels, from basic unit testing to enterprise-scale TDD implementations.

## Coverage Philosophy

This by-example guide provides practical coverage of TDD through annotated examples. The focus is on **implementing TDD workflows**, not just theory.

### What's Covered

- **TDD fundamentals** - Red-Green-Refactor cycle, test-first thinking
- **Testing patterns** - Assertions, fixtures, test organization
- **Test doubles** - Mocks, stubs, fakes, spies
- **Advanced techniques** - Asynchronous testing, property-based testing, mutation testing
- **Production patterns** - TDD with databases, web apps, microservices
- **Legacy code** - Characterization tests, refactoring strategies
- **Enterprise TDD** - Test architecture, scaling patterns, performance

### What's NOT Covered

- BDD and acceptance testing (see BDD tutorial for stakeholder collaboration)
- Manual testing techniques (see testing fundamentals)
- Framework documentation beyond common patterns

## Prerequisites

- Programming experience in at least one language (Java, JavaScript, Python, Go, or similar)
- Basic understanding of functions, classes, and control flow
- Familiarity with testing concepts (assertions, test runners)

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent format:

1. **Brief Explanation**: What TDD concept the example demonstrates
2. **Test Code (Red)**: Failing test showing requirements
3. **Implementation (Green)**: Minimal code to pass the test
4. **Refactored Version**: Improved design preserving behavior
5. **Key Takeaway**: The core TDD principle to retain

This structure provides the complete TDD cycle in every example, reinforcing the rhythm of test-first development.
