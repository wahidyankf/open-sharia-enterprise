**Want to learn React through code?** This by-example tutorial provides 75-90 heavily annotated examples covering 95% of React + TypeScript. Master React idioms, patterns, and best practices through working code rather than lengthy explanations.

## What Is By-Example Learning?

By-example learning is a **code-first approach** where you learn concepts through annotated, working examples rather than narrative explanations. Each example shows:

1. **What the code does** - Brief explanation of the React concept
2. **How it works** - A focused, heavily commented code example
3. **Why it matters** - A pattern summary highlighting the key takeaway
4. **Expected output** - What you'll see when running the code
5. **Common pitfalls** - Mistakes to avoid with this pattern

This approach works best when you already understand programming fundamentals and basic web development concepts. You learn React's component model, hooks system, and TypeScript integration by studying real code rather than theoretical descriptions.

## What Is React?

React is a **JavaScript library for building user interfaces** that prioritizes component composition and declarative rendering. Key distinctions:

- **Not a framework**: React focuses on the view layer; routing, state management, and other concerns require additional libraries
- **Component-based**: UI built from reusable, composable components with clear boundaries
- **Declarative**: Describe what UI should look like for any state; React handles DOM updates efficiently
- **TypeScript integration**: Strong typing provides better developer experience and catches errors early
- **Modern patterns**: Hooks, Context API, Suspense enable powerful composition without class components

## Coverage Philosophy: 95% Through 75-90 Examples

The **95% coverage** means you'll understand React deeply enough to build production applications with confidence. It doesn't mean you'll know every edge case or advanced optimization—those come with experience.

The 75-90 examples are organized progressively:

- **Beginner (Examples 1-25)**: Foundation concepts (JSX, components, props, state, basic hooks, event handling, conditional rendering)
- **Intermediate (Examples 26-50)**: Production patterns (custom hooks, context, forms, data fetching, routing, error boundaries, performance basics)
- **Advanced (Examples 51-90)**: Scale and optimization (advanced patterns, performance optimization, testing strategies, accessibility, deployment patterns)

Together, these examples cover **95% of what you'll use** in production React applications.

## Annotation Density: 1-2.25 Comments Per Code Line

**CRITICAL**: All examples maintain **1-2.25 comment lines per code line PER EXAMPLE** to ensure deep understanding.

**What this means**:

- Simple lines get 1 annotation explaining purpose or result
- Complex lines get 2+ annotations explaining behavior, state changes, and side effects
- Use `// =>` notation to show expected values, outputs, or state changes

**Example**:

```typescript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);     // => count is 0 initially (type: number)
                                           // => setCount updates count and triggers re-render

const handleClick = () => {                // => Event handler for button clicks
  setCount(count + 1);                     // => Increments count by 1
                                           // => Component re-renders with new count
};

return <button onClick={handleClick}>     {/* => Button displays current count */}
  Count: {count}                          {/* => Shows "Count: 0" initially */}
</button>;                                 {/* => Updates to "Count: 1" after click */}
```

This density ensures each example is self-contained and fully comprehensible without external documentation.

## Structure of Each Example

All examples follow a consistent five-part format:

````
### Example N: Descriptive Title

2-3 sentence explanation of the concept.

```typescript
// Heavily annotated code example
// showing the React pattern in action
````

**Key Takeaway**: 1-2 sentence summary.

**Expected Output**: What you'll see when running this code.

**Common Pitfalls**: 1-2 mistakes developers often make with this pattern.

````

**Code annotations**:

- `// =>` shows expected output, state changes, or results
- Inline comments explain what each line does
- Variable names are self-documenting
- Type annotations make data flow explicit

## Getting Started

Before starting the examples, ensure you have basic environment setup:

1. **Review Initial Setup**: [Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/fe-react/initial-setup) - Install Node.js, npm, and create React + TypeScript project
2. **Try Quick Start**: [Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/platform-web/fe-react/quick-start) - Build a simple todo app to understand React basics

These tutorials provide hands-on foundation before diving into by-example learning.

## How to Use This Guide

### 1. Choose Your Starting Point

- **New to React?** Start with Beginner (Example 1)
- **Framework experience** (Angular, Vue)? Start with Intermediate (Example 21)
- **Building specific feature?** Search for relevant example topic

### 2. Read the Example

Each example has five parts:

- **Explanation** (2-3 sentences): What React concept, why it exists, when to use it
- **Code** (heavily commented): Working TypeScript code showing the pattern
- **Key Takeaway** (1-2 sentences): Distilled essence of the pattern
- **Expected Output**: What you'll see when running the code
- **Common Pitfalls**: Mistakes to avoid

### 3. Run the Code

Create a test project and run each example:

```bash
npm create vite@latest react-examples -- --template react-ts
cd react-examples
npm install
# Paste example code into src/App.tsx
npm run dev
````

### 4. Modify and Experiment

Change props, add state, break things on purpose. Experimentation builds intuition faster than reading.

### 5. Reference as Needed

Use this guide as a reference when building features. Search for relevant examples and adapt patterns to your code.
