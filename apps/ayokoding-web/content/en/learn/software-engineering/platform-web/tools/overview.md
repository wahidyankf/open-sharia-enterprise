This section covers web development frameworks and tools organized by technology stack. Each framework includes comprehensive tutorials, code examples, and best practices for building modern web applications.

## Available Frameworks

### Frontend Frameworks

**React** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces with component-based architecture and virtual DOM.

**Next.js** - React framework with server-side rendering, static site generation, and full-stack capabilities.

### Backend Frameworks

**Elixir Phoenix** - Productive web framework built on Elixir and Erlang VM for highly concurrent, fault-tolerant applications.

**Phoenix LiveView** - Real-time, server-rendered web applications without JavaScript frameworks using Phoenix.

**Spring Framework** - Comprehensive Java framework for enterprise applications with dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.

**Spring Boot** - Opinionated Spring configuration for building production-ready applications quickly.

## Learning Path

Each framework follows a consistent learning structure:

1. **Overview** - Introduction, key features, when to use, comparison with alternatives
2. **Initial Setup** - Installation, project setup, first application (0-5% coverage)
3. **Quick Start** - Complete working example with walkthrough (5-30% coverage)
4. **By Example** - 75-90 annotated code examples for 95% coverage (where available)

Choose a framework based on your project requirements, team expertise, and technical constraints.
