description: Master cloud platforms, container orchestration, and infrastructure as code
---

Platforms provide the infrastructure foundation for deploying and running software applications at scale. This section covers cloud providers, container orchestration, and infrastructure automation.

## What You'll Learn

- **Cloud Providers** - AWS, Google Cloud, Azure fundamentals and services
- **Container Orchestration** - Kubernetes, Docker, container networking
- **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation
- **CI/CD Platforms** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI
- **Serverless Computing** - Lambda, Cloud Functions, serverless architectures
- **Platform Engineering** - Building internal developer platforms

## Platform Categories

### Cloud Providers

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) ecosystem
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services
- Microsoft Azure infrastructure
- Multi-cloud and hybrid strategies

### Container & Orchestration
