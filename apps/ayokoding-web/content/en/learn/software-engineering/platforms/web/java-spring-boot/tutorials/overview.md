description: Introduction to Java Spring Boot web framework tutorials covering hands-on learning through annotated examples
---

The Java Spring Boot tutorials provide practical, hands-on learning for developers who want to master modern web application development with Spring Boot framework. These tutorials emphasize real-world applications and direct code exploration.

## Tutorial Structure

This section offers a code-first learning approach through the **by-example** tutorial methodology. Rather than lengthy explanations, you'll learn Spring Boot web development through annotated, working examples that demonstrate actual usage patterns.

### By Example Tutorial

The [By Example tutorial](/en/learn/software-engineering/platforms/web/java-spring-boot/tutorials/by-example) provides comprehensive coverage of Spring Boot framework fundamentals through 75-90 annotated examples. This approach suits experienced developers who prefer learning through code exploration.

**What you'll learn:**

- Spring Boot project setup and application structure
- REST API development with Spring MVC
- Database interactions with Spring Data JPA
- Security with Spring Security
- Testing Spring Boot applications
- Microservices patterns and deployment

**Who it's for:**

- Developers with web development experience
- Professionals transitioning to Java and Spring Boot
- Engineers seeking enterprise application development skills
- Anyone comfortable learning from annotated code examples

## Tutorial Philosophy

These tutorials follow a **learning-by-doing** approach:

- **Code-first presentation** - Examples before theory
- **Annotated code** - Inline comments explain syntax and behavior
- **Progressive complexity** - Basic patterns to advanced techniques
- **Real-world scenarios** - Practical code used in actual applications
- **Immediate applicability** - Copy, modify, and use in your projects

## Prerequisites

All tutorials assume:

- Basic Java knowledge (syntax, OOP concepts, generics)
- Familiarity with web development concepts (HTTP, REST, MVC)
- PostgreSQL or MySQL database access (local or Docker)
- IDE with Java support (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)

No prior Spring Boot experience required - the examples teach framework patterns through demonstration.

## Getting Started

Start with the [By Example tutorial](/en/learn/software-engineering/platforms/web/java-spring-boot/tutorials/by-example) to learn Spring Boot web development through annotated, practical examples. Work through the examples at your own pace, experimenting with code and adapting patterns to your applications.

## Content Status

The by-example tutorial structure is in place and under active development. Content will include comprehensive coverage of Spring Boot fundamentals, Spring Data JPA patterns, Spring Security implementation, RESTful API design, microservices architecture, and production deployment strategies.
