description: Build production-ready enterprise applications with Spring Boot on the JVM platform
---

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework built on the Spring ecosystem that simplifies the creation of production-ready, stand-alone Spring applications. It provides convention-over-configuration defaults while maintaining full flexibility for customization.

## What You'll Learn

- **Spring Boot Fundamentals** - Auto-configuration, starters, and application structure
- **REST API Development** - Controllers, request mapping, and response handling
- **Data Access** - Spring Data JPA, repositories, and database integration
- **Security** - Authentication, authorization, and Spring Security configuration
- **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, and test containers
- **Production Features** - Actuator, monitoring, logging, and deployment

## Platform Characteristics

### Convention Over Configuration

Spring Boot eliminates boilerplate configuration through intelligent defaults and auto-configuration. Start building features immediately without extensive XML or annotation setup.

### Enterprise-Grade Ecosystem

Access the complete Spring ecosystem including Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, and Spring Batch. Build everything from simple REST APIs to complex microservices architectures.

### Production-Ready Features

Spring Boot Actuator provides built-in health checks, metrics, and monitoring endpoints. Applications come ready for production deployment with minimal additional configuration.

### Broad Database Support

Spring Data JPA abstracts database interactions with repository patterns supporting PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, MongoDB, and many other data stores through consistent interfaces.

## Getting Started

Spring Boot development typically progresses through:

1. **Project Initialization** - Spring Initializr and dependency management
2. **Core Concepts** - Controllers, services, repositories, and entities
3. **REST API Design** - Building RESTful web services
4. **Database Integration** - JPA entities, repositories, and migrations
5. **Security Implementation** - Authentication and authorization patterns
6. **Testing Strategies** - Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
7. **Deployment** - Packaging and deployment to cloud platforms

## Common Use Cases

- **Enterprise REST APIs** - Microservices and API backends
- **Web Applications** - Server-side rendered web applications with Thymeleaf
- **Batch Processing** - Scheduled jobs and data processing pipelines
- **Cloud-Native Applications** - Spring Cloud for distributed systems
- **Integration Platforms** - Enterprise integration patterns with Spring Integration
- **Data Processing** - ETL pipelines and data transformation
