---

Web platforms encompass the frameworks, tools, and services for building, deploying, and scaling web applications across different programming ecosystems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Frontend Frameworks** - React, Vue, Angular, Svelte for interactive UIs
- **Backend Frameworks** - Express, FastAPI, Django, Spring Boot for server development
- **Full-Stack Frameworks** - Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit for end-to-end applications
- **JVM Web Platforms** - Spring Boot, Quarkus, Ktor for enterprise applications
- **Elixir Web Platform** - Phoenix Framework and LiveView for real-time applications
- **Deployment Platforms** - Vercel, Netlify, Railway for web hosting
