description: Master web application development with Spring Boot and Phoenix frameworks
---

Web platforms provide comprehensive frameworks for building modern web applications. This section covers backend web frameworks for Java and Elixir ecosystems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Java Spring Boot** - Enterprise-grade web applications on the JVM
- **Elixir Phoenix** - Real-time web applications with fault tolerance

## Available Platforms

### Java Spring Boot - JVM Web Framework

**[Java Spring Boot](/en/learn/software-engineering/web-platform/java-spring-boot)** simplifies enterprise web development:

- **Auto-Configuration** - Minimal setup with sensible defaults
- **REST APIs** - Build RESTful web services with Spring MVC
- **Dependency Injection** - Inversion of control container
- **Data Access** - Integration with Spring Data JPA and JDBC
- **Security** - Authentication and authorization with Spring Security
- **Testing** - Comprehensive testing support with MockMvc
- **Production Features** - Actuator endpoints for monitoring and health checks
- **Ecosystem** - Integration with Spring Cloud, Spring Batch, Spring WebFlux

### Elixir Phoenix - Real-Time Web Framework

**[Elixir Phoenix](/en/learn/software-engineering/web-platform/elixir-phoenix)** delivers high-performance concurrent web applications:

- **MVC Architecture** - Model-View-Controller pattern with functional programming
- **LiveView** - Real-time server-rendered UI without JavaScript
- **Channels** - WebSocket-based real-time communication
- **Ecto Integration** - Database access with composable queries
- **Fault Tolerance** - OTP supervision trees for resilient applications
- **Scalability** - Handle millions of connections on a single machine
- **Generators** - Code generation for rapid development
- **Testing** - Built-in testing framework with async support

## Learning Path

Each platform provides **By Example** tutorials:

- **Beginner** - Setup, routing, controllers, views, basic CRUD
- **Intermediate** - Authentication, APIs, database integration, testing
- **Advanced** - Real-time features, performance optimization, deployment

Learn through practical, annotated code examples you can run immediately.

## Platform Comparison

### When to Use Spring Boot

- **Enterprise applications** with complex business logic
- **JVM ecosystem** integration (Kafka, Hadoop, Cassandra)
- **Team experience** with Java and object-oriented programming
- **Microservices** architecture with Spring Cloud
- **Large teams** benefiting from Spring's structure and conventions

### When to Use Phoenix

- **Real-time applications** (chat, collaboration tools, live dashboards)
- **Concurrent workloads** with thousands of simultaneous users
- **Fault tolerance** requirements for always-on systems
- **Functional programming** preference
- **LiveView** for interactive UIs without heavy JavaScript

## Getting Started

Choose the platform matching your language and requirements:

- **Java developers** → [Java Spring Boot](/en/learn/software-engineering/web-platform/java-spring-boot)
- **Elixir developers** → [Elixir Phoenix](/en/learn/software-engineering/web-platform/elixir-phoenix)
- **Need real-time features** → Phoenix with LiveView or Channels
- **Enterprise applications** → Spring Boot with Spring ecosystem

Both platforms assume programming experience in their respective languages. Complete the [Java](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/java) or [Elixir](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/elixir) tutorials first if you're new to the language.
