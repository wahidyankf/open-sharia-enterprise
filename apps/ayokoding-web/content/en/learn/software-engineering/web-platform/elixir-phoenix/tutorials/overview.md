description: Introduction to Elixir Phoenix web framework tutorials covering hands-on learning through annotated examples
---

The Elixir Phoenix tutorials provide practical, hands-on learning for developers who want to master modern web application development with Phoenix framework. These tutorials emphasize real-world applications and direct code exploration.

## Tutorial Structure

This section offers a code-first learning approach through the **by-example** tutorial methodology. Rather than lengthy explanations, you'll learn Phoenix web development through annotated, working examples that demonstrate actual usage patterns.

### By Example Tutorial

The [By Example tutorial](/en/learn/software-engineering/web-platform/elixir-phoenix/tutorials/by-example) provides comprehensive coverage of Phoenix framework fundamentals through 75-90 annotated examples. This approach suits experienced developers who prefer learning through code exploration.

**What you'll learn:**

- Phoenix project setup and application structure
- Routing, controllers, and views
- Database interactions with Ecto
- Real-time features with Phoenix LiveView and Channels
- Testing Phoenix applications
- Authentication and authorization patterns

**Who it's for:**

- Developers with web development experience
- Professionals transitioning to Elixir and Phoenix
- Engineers seeking functional web development skills
- Anyone comfortable learning from annotated code examples

## Tutorial Philosophy

These tutorials follow a **learning-by-doing** approach:

- **Code-first presentation** - Examples before theory
- **Annotated code** - Inline comments explain syntax and behavior
- **Progressive complexity** - Basic patterns to advanced techniques
- **Real-world scenarios** - Practical code used in actual applications
- **Immediate applicability** - Copy, modify, and use in your projects

## Prerequisites

All tutorials assume:

- Basic Elixir knowledge (syntax, pattern matching, modules)
- Familiarity with web development concepts (HTTP, REST, MVC)
- PostgreSQL database access (local or Docker)
- Text editor or IDE with Elixir support

No prior Phoenix experience required - the examples teach framework patterns through demonstration.

## Getting Started

Start with the [By Example tutorial](/en/learn/software-engineering/web-platform/elixir-phoenix/tutorials/by-example) to learn Phoenix web development through annotated, practical examples. Work through the examples at your own pace, experimenting with code and adapting patterns to your applications.

## Content Status

The by-example tutorial structure is in place and under active development. Content will include comprehensive coverage of Phoenix fundamentals, LiveView interactivity, Ecto database patterns, real-time features, and production deployment strategies.
