description: Build real-time, fault-tolerant web applications with Phoenix Framework on the Elixir platform
---

Phoenix is a web framework built with Elixir that leverages the power of the Erlang VM (BEAM) to deliver high-performance, real-time web applications with exceptional fault tolerance and concurrency.

## What You'll Learn

- **Phoenix Framework Basics** - MVC architecture, routing, controllers, and views
- **LiveView** - Building real-time, interactive UIs without JavaScript
- **Ecto Database Layer** - Schema definitions, queries, migrations, and changesets
- **Channels & PubSub** - Real-time bidirectional communication
- **Deployment** - Production deployment strategies for Phoenix applications
- **OTP Principles** - Supervision trees, GenServers, and fault tolerance

## Platform Characteristics

### Real-Time by Default

Phoenix includes first-class support for real-time features through Channels and LiveView. Build interactive, low-latency applications that push updates to clients instantly without complex JavaScript frameworks.

### Fault-Tolerant Architecture

Built on the Erlang VM, Phoenix applications inherit decades of battle-tested fault tolerance patterns. Processes crash and restart automatically, ensuring your application stays available even under failure conditions.

### Scalability & Performance

The BEAM VM's lightweight processes and efficient scheduling enable Phoenix to handle millions of concurrent connections on a single server. Horizontal scaling is straightforward with distributed Erlang clustering.

### Developer Productivity

Phoenix provides a productive development experience with code reloading, comprehensive testing tools, and a clear MVC structure. LiveView enables building rich UIs with minimal JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Phoenix development follows this typical progression:

1. **Environment Setup** - Install Elixir, Phoenix, and PostgreSQL
2. **Core Concepts** - Routes, controllers, templates, and contexts
3. **Database Integration** - Ecto schemas, migrations, and queries
4. **Real-Time Features** - Channels for WebSocket communication
5. **LiveView Applications** - Server-rendered interactive UIs
6. **Production Deployment** - Release management and deployment

## Common Use Cases

- **Real-Time Dashboards** - Live data visualization and monitoring
- **Chat Applications** - Instant messaging and collaboration tools
- **Trading Platforms** - Low-latency financial applications
- **IoT Backends** - Managing thousands of connected devices
- **Gaming Servers** - Multiplayer game backends
- **Collaborative Tools** - Real-time document editing and collaboration
