**Want to master Domain-Driven Design through practical examples?** This by-example guide teaches DDD through annotated code and diagram examples organized by complexity level.

## What Is DDD By-Example Learning?

DDD by-example learning is a **pattern-first approach** where you learn through practical implementations of DDD concepts rather than narrative explanations. Each example shows:

- **Domain modeling** - How to model complex business domains
- **Tactical patterns** - Entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, services
- **Strategic patterns** - Bounded contexts, context mapping, domain events
- **Working code** - Runnable examples showing DDD in practice

This approach is **ideal for developers and architects** who want to apply DDD principles to real-world software systems.

## Learning Path

The DDD by-example tutorial guides you through examples organized into three progressive levels, from basic building blocks to complex strategic patterns.

## Coverage Philosophy

This by-example guide provides practical coverage of DDD through annotated examples. The focus is on **applying DDD patterns**, not just understanding theory.

### What's Covered

- **Building blocks** - Entities, value objects, aggregates, domain events
- **Tactical patterns** - Repositories, factories, services, domain events
- **Strategic patterns** - Bounded contexts, context maps, anti-corruption layers
- **Domain modeling** - Ubiquitous language, aggregates design, event storming
- **Integration patterns** - Shared kernel, customer-supplier, conformist

### What's NOT Covered

- Deep DDD philosophy (see by-concept tutorials for conceptual understanding)
- Framework-specific implementations (examples use language-agnostic patterns)
- Event sourcing and CQRS advanced patterns (separate tutorials)

## Prerequisites

- Object-oriented programming experience
- Understanding of software design patterns
- Experience with business domain modeling

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent format:

1. **Brief Explanation**: What DDD concept the example demonstrates
2. **Domain Context**: Business scenario being modeled
3. **Code/Diagram**: Implementation showing the pattern
4. **Design Decisions**: Why this approach was chosen
5. **Key Takeaway**: The core DDD principle to retain

This structure provides context, implementation, and understanding all in one place.
