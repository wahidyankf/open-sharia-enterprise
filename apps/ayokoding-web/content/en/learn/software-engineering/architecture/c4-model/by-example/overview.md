**Want to master C4 Model architecture diagrams through practical examples?** This by-example guide teaches C4 Model through annotated diagram examples organized by complexity level.

## What Is C4 Model By-Example Learning?

C4 Model by-example learning is a **diagram-first approach** where you learn through annotated, practical architecture diagrams rather than narrative explanations. Each example shows:

- **What the diagram represents** - Clear explanation of the architectural view
- **Key elements** - Identification of systems, containers, components, and relationships
- **Design decisions** - Rationale behind structural choices
- **Mermaid diagrams** - Working C4 diagrams you can modify and use

This approach is **ideal for software architects and developers** who need to document and communicate system architecture using the C4 Model framework.

## Learning Path

The C4 Model by-example tutorial guides you through examples organized into three progressive levels, from basic system context to detailed code-level architecture.

## Coverage Philosophy

This by-example guide provides practical coverage of C4 Model through annotated diagram examples. The focus is on **real-world architecture visualization**, not theoretical concepts.

### What's Covered

- **System Context diagrams** - High-level system relationships and external dependencies
- **Container diagrams** - Major technical building blocks and their interactions
- **Component diagrams** - Internal structure of containers
- **Code diagrams** - Class-level details when needed
- **Supplementary diagrams** - Dynamic views, deployment views

### What's NOT Covered

- Deep architectural theory (see by-concept tutorials for conceptual understanding)
- Tool-specific implementations beyond Mermaid
- Organization-specific notation conventions

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of software architecture concepts
- Familiarity with system design principles
- Experience reading technical diagrams

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent format:

1. **Brief Explanation**: What the example demonstrates and why it matters
2. **C4 Diagram**: Mermaid diagram showing the architecture
3. **Key Elements**: Explanation of major components and relationships
4. **Design Rationale**: Why this structure was chosen
5. **Key Takeaway**: The core insight to retain

This structure provides context, visualization, and understanding all in one place.
