**Want to master Finite State Machines through practical examples?** This by-example guide teaches FSM through annotated code and diagram examples organized by complexity level.

## What Is FSM By-Example Learning?

FSM by-example learning is a **code-first approach** where you learn through practical implementations of state machines rather than narrative explanations. Each example shows:

- **State diagrams** - Visual representation of states and transitions
- **Working code** - Runnable implementations showing FSM in practice
- **State transitions** - How events trigger state changes
- **Guards and actions** - Conditional logic and side effects

This approach is **ideal for developers** who want to implement robust state management using finite state machine patterns.

## Learning Path

The FSM by-example tutorial guides you through examples organized into three progressive levels, from simple state machines to complex hierarchical patterns.

## Coverage Philosophy

This by-example guide provides practical coverage of FSM through annotated examples. The focus is on **implementing state machines**, not just theory.

### What's Covered

- **Basic FSM** - States, transitions, events, initial and final states
- **Guards and actions** - Conditional transitions, entry/exit actions
- **Hierarchical states** - Nested states, state composition
- **State patterns** - State pattern, strategy pattern integration
- **Real-world applications** - Order processing, user authentication, workflow engines

### What's NOT Covered

- Formal automata theory (see by-concept tutorials for theoretical foundations)
- Framework-specific implementations (XState, Statecharts libraries)
- Complex statechart extensions (orthogonal regions, history states)

## Prerequisites

- Programming experience in any language
- Understanding of control flow (if/else, switch)
- Familiarity with object-oriented patterns

## Structure of Each Example

Every example follows a consistent format:

1. **Brief Explanation**: What FSM concept the example demonstrates
2. **State Diagram**: Mermaid diagram showing states and transitions
3. **Annotated Code**: Implementation with inline comments
4. **Example Execution**: Sample input and state changes
5. **Key Takeaway**: The core FSM principle to retain

This structure provides visualization, implementation, and understanding all in one place.
