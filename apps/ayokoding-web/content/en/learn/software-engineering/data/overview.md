description: Master data engineering concepts and tools for building robust data systems
---

Data is a fundamental pillar of modern software engineering. This section provides comprehensive coverage of data concepts and the tools used to work with data effectively.

## What You'll Learn

- **Data Concepts** - Understand data structures, modeling, storage patterns, and architectural principles
- **Data Tools** - Master databases, query languages, data processing frameworks, and ETL pipelines

## Learning Path

The content is organized into two main areas:

### Concepts

Focuses on fundamental understanding of data principles:

- Data structures and algorithms
- Database design and normalization
- Data modeling techniques
- Consistency models and transactions
- Data architecture patterns
- Data quality and governance

### Tools

Covers practical tools and technologies:

- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra)
- Query languages (SQL, GraphQL)
- Data processing frameworks (Apache Spark, Kafka)
- ETL tools and pipelines
- Data warehousing solutions

Each area follows the Diátaxis framework with tutorials, how-to guides, explanations, and reference materials to support different learning needs.
