description: Master SQL fundamentals and PostgreSQL database management
---

Databases are specialized systems for storing, organizing, and retrieving data efficiently. This section focuses on relational database fundamentals with SQL and PostgreSQL.

## What You'll Learn

- **SQL** - The standard language for relational database querying and manipulation
- **PostgreSQL** - Advanced open-source relational database with powerful features
- **Database Design** - Schema design, normalization, and indexing strategies
- **Query Optimization** - Performance tuning and query analysis
- **Transactions** - ACID properties, isolation levels, and concurrency control

## Available Databases

### SQL - Universal Database Language

**[SQL](/en/learn/software-engineering/data/databases/sql)** provides the foundation for working with relational databases:

- **Query Fundamentals** - SELECT, WHERE, JOIN for data retrieval
- **Data Manipulation** - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- **Schema Definition** - CREATE TABLE, indexes, constraints
- **Aggregation** - GROUP BY, HAVING, aggregate functions
- **Advanced Queries** - Subqueries, window functions, CTEs
- **Transactions** - BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK

### PostgreSQL - Production Database System

**[PostgreSQL](/en/learn/software-engineering/data/databases/postgresql)** extends SQL with advanced features:

- **Advanced Data Types** - JSON, arrays, ranges, custom types
- **Performance Features** - Parallel queries, partitioning, materialized views
- **Full-Text Search** - Built-in text search capabilities
- **Extensions** - PostGIS for geospatial, pg_trgm for fuzzy matching
- **Replication** - Streaming replication, logical replication
- **Administration** - Backup strategies, performance tuning, monitoring

## Learning Path

1. **Start with SQL fundamentals** - Learn the universal language of databases
2. **Explore PostgreSQL** - Apply SQL knowledge to a production database
3. **Practice with examples** - Work through By Example tutorials with runnable code

Each database provides **By Example** tutorials:

- **Beginner** - Core concepts and basic operations (0-60% coverage)
- **Intermediate** - Production patterns and optimization (60-85% coverage)
- **Advanced** - Complex queries and administration (85-95% coverage)

## Database Operations

Topics covered across SQL and PostgreSQL tutorials:

- **Schema Design** - Normalization, relationships, constraints
- **Query Optimization** - Indexes, EXPLAIN plans, query tuning
- **Transactions** - ACID guarantees, isolation levels, deadlocks
- **Backup & Recovery** - pg_dump, WAL archiving, point-in-time recovery
- **Security** - User management, role-based access, SSL connections
- **Monitoring** - pg_stat views, performance metrics, logging

## Getting Started

Begin with **[SQL](/en/learn/software-engineering/data/databases/sql)** to build a strong foundation in relational database concepts. Then explore **[PostgreSQL](/en/learn/software-engineering/data/databases/postgresql)** to learn production database features and administration.

Both paths include practical, annotated examples you can run immediately.
