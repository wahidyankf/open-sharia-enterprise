description: Comprehensive Elixir Ecto database wrapper overview covering schemas, queries, changesets, associations, transactions, and production patterns with 85 annotated examples
---

Ecto is Elixir's database wrapper and query generator providing a composable API for database interactions with strong compile-time guarantees.

## Getting Started

Before diving into Ecto development, get up and running:

1. **[Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/data/tools/elixir-ecto/initial-setup)** - Install Elixir, Ecto, PostgreSQL, configure database connection
2. **[Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/data/tools/elixir-ecto/quick-start)** - Your first schema, basic queries, essential patterns

These foundational tutorials (0-30% coverage) prepare you for comprehensive Ecto learning.

## What You'll Learn

- **Schemas** - Define database tables as Elixir structs
- **Queries** - Compose type-safe database queries with Ecto.Query
- **Changesets** - Validate and transform data before database operations
- **Associations** - Model relationships between tables (belongs_to, has_many, many_to_many)
- **Migrations** - Version control database schema changes
- **Transactions** - Ensure data consistency with Ecto.Multi
- **Production Patterns** - Connection pooling, prepared statements, query optimization
