description: Spring Data JPA database access overview covering repositories, entities, queries, transactions, and production patterns
---

Spring Data JPA simplifies database access in Spring Boot applications by providing repository abstractions over JPA (Java Persistence API).

## Getting Started

Before diving into Spring Data JPA development, get up and running:

1. **[Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/data/tools/spring-data-jpa/initial-setup)** - Install Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot, configure database connection, H2/PostgreSQL setup
2. **[Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/data/tools/spring-data-jpa/quick-start)** - Your first entity and repository, basic CRUD operations, essential patterns

These foundational tutorials (0-30% coverage) prepare you for comprehensive Spring Data JPA learning in both Java and Kotlin.

## What You'll Learn

- **Entities** - Map Java/Kotlin classes to database tables with JPA annotations
- **Repositories** - Define data access interfaces with Spring Data JPA conventions
- **Query Methods** - Write queries using method naming conventions (findByNameAndAge)
- **JPQL Queries** - Write custom queries using Java Persistence Query Language
- **Specifications** - Build type-safe dynamic queries with Criteria API
- **Relationships** - Model associations (OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany)
- **Transactions** - Manage database transactions declaratively with @Transactional
- **Production Patterns** - Connection pooling, lazy loading, caching, pagination
