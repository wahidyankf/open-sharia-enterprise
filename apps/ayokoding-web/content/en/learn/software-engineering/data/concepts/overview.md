description: Fundamental data concepts for building robust software systems
---

Understanding data concepts is essential for designing effective software systems. This section covers the theoretical foundations and architectural principles that guide data engineering decisions.

## What You'll Learn

- **Data Structures** - Arrays, trees, graphs, and specialized structures for different use cases
- **Database Design** - Normalization, schema design, and data modeling techniques
- **Data Architecture** - Patterns for organizing and managing data at scale
- **Consistency Models** - ACID properties, CAP theorem, and eventual consistency
- **Data Quality** - Validation, cleaning, and governance principles
- **Performance** - Indexing strategies, query optimization, and caching patterns

## Learning Approach

The content is organized following the Diátaxis framework:

- **Tutorials** - Step-by-step lessons to build understanding from the ground up
- **How-to Guides** - Practical solutions for specific data design challenges
- **Explanation** - Deep dives into data concepts, trade-offs, and best practices
- **Reference** - Quick lookup for data patterns, terminology, and decision frameworks

Start with tutorials if you're new to data concepts, or jump to specific sections based on your needs.
