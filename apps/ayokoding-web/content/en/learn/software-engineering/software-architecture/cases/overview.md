**You have finished the by-example tracks for C4, DDD, Hexagonal Architecture, and Finite State Machines. You know what an aggregate is. You know what a port is. You know how to draw a Container diagram. You know how to model a state machine. Now the question is: how do they all wire together in a real production codebase that ships?** This section answers that question through two parallel cases against the same shared Procure-to-Pay domain — so the only thing that changes between cases is the language and framework.

## What "Case" Means Here

A **case** is a comprehensive worked treatment of the four architecture pattern families on a single coherent domain. Each case integrates:

- **C4** — how the service and its bounded contexts are drawn (Context, Container, Component)
- **DDD** — how the business problem is carved into bounded contexts, aggregates, value objects, and domain events
- **Hexagonal Architecture** — how source code is structured so the domain core never depends on infrastructure (ports, adapters, composition root)
- **FSM** — how aggregate lifecycles move through their states (state types, transition functions, guards)

The cases here teach the **wiring decisions** — how these four families meet in code — not the families themselves. The four `by-example` tracks earlier in this section teach the families in isolation; the cases here show them composed.

## What's in this section

Two production cases, both running against the hypothetical `procurement-platform-be` service (Purchase Requisitions → POs → Goods Receipt → Three-Way Matching → Payment):

- [In FP — F# / Giraffe / Npgsql](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/cases/in-fp) — Functional-programming flavor; 27 guides
- [In OOP — Java / Spring Boot](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/cases/in-oop) — Object-oriented flavor; 27 guides

Both cases share the same 27-guide numbering (beginner 1–6/7, intermediate 8–14/15, advanced 15/16–22, production 23–27) so cross-paradigm comparison is trivial: Guide 5's F# port definition versus Guide 5's Java interface definition is a single side-by-side read.

## Prerequisites

Complete the four by-example tracks before starting either case:

- **C4 by-example**: [overview](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/c4-model/by-example/overview)
- **DDD by-example**: [FP track](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/in-fp-by-example) or [OOP track](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/in-oop-by-example)
- **Hexagonal by-example**: [FP track](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/hexagonal-architecture/in-fp-by-example) or [OOP track](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/hexagonal-architecture/in-oop-by-example)
- **FSM by-example**: [FP track](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/finite-state-machine-fsm/in-fp-by-example) or [OOP track](/en/learn/software-engineering/software-architecture/finite-state-machine-fsm/in-oop-by-example)

The cases use terms like _container_, _component_, _aggregate_, _port_, _adapter_, _bounded context_, _repository pattern_, and _state machine_ without redefinition. If any feel unfamiliar, finish the relevant prerequisite track first.

## How the Four Families Compose

The four families operate at different levels and slot together as follows:

| Family  | Level     | Question Answered                          |
| ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **C4**  | Views     | _How do we draw the system?_               |
| **DDD** | Domain    | _How do we carve the business problem?_    |
| **Hex** | Structure | _Where does each piece of code live?_      |
| **FSM** | Behavior  | _How does an aggregate move through life?_ |

The stack reads top-down. **C4** describes any system independent of paradigm. **DDD** defines the units inside one C4 container. **Hexagonal Architecture** organizes the source tree implementing one DDD bounded context. **FSM** lives at the deepest layer, encoded inside an aggregate root, governing transitions that the application layer triggers through input ports.

```
C4 Container (one deployable service, e.g. procurement-platform-be)
    └── DDD bounded context (e.g. purchasing)
        └── Hexagonal hexagon (domain core + ports + adapters)
            └── DDD aggregate root (e.g. PurchaseOrder)
                └── FSM (PurchaseOrder lifecycle: draft → pending → approved → issued → ...)
```

Every guide in each case touches one or more of these layers explicitly.

## Running Domain — Procure-to-Pay Procurement Platform

Both cases reason against the same hypothetical service: `procurement-platform-be`, the backend of a Procure-to-Pay (P2P) procurement platform.

| Bounded context    | Aggregate root                              | Responsibility                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `purchasing`       | `PurchaseRequisition`, `PurchaseOrder`      | Requisition lifecycle, approval routing, PO issuance          |
| `supplier`         | `Supplier`                                  | Vendor master, approval state, risk score                     |
| `receiving`        | `GoodsReceiptNote`                          | Goods receipt against PO, quantity verification               |
| `invoicing`        | `Invoice`                                   | Invoice registration, three-way matching (PO ↔ GRN ↔ Invoice) |
| `payments`         | `Payment`                                   | Payment run scheduling, bank disbursement                     |
| `murabaha-finance` | `MurabahaContract` _(optional Sharia tier)_ | Bank-purchased asset, markup contract, repayment schedule     |

Same contexts, same aggregates, same domain events, same ports, same state machines across both cases — only the language and framework idioms differ.

## Why Two Parallel Cases

Comparing the F# wiring of Guide 5 (a port as a function type alias) against the Java wiring of Guide 5 (a port as an interface) against the same business problem is the fastest way to internalise the structural decisions that hexagonal architecture, DDD, and the C4/FSM frames demand — regardless of which paradigm you ultimately ship with.
