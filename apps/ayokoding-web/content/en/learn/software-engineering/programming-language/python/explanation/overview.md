## Python Explanation Guides

These conceptual articles explore the principles and philosophy behind Python development. Rather than solving specific problems, they explain the "why" behind Python's design decisions and best practices.

## Available Explanations

**[Python Best Practices](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-language/python/explanation/best-practices)** - Core principles that guide quality Python code, from Pythonic idioms to design patterns.

**[Common Python Anti-Patterns](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-language/python/explanation/anti-patterns)** - Patterns that seem reasonable but create problems, with explanations of why they fail and what to do instead.

## Understanding Python Philosophy

Python's design philosophy, captured in "The Zen of Python" (PEP 20), guides both the language itself and the patterns the community considers idiomatic. These explanation guides connect that philosophy to practical code patterns, helping you write not just working Python but Pythonic Python.
