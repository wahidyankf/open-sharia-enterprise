**Coverage**: 0-5% of Python knowledge

**What you'll learn**: Install Python with pyenv or system package manager, set up virtual environments with venv, verify installation, run your first "Hello, World!" program, understand Python's interactive REPL.

**Prerequisites**: None - complete beginner friendly

**Estimated length**: 400-500 lines

---

### Level 2: Quick Start (5-30%)

[Python Quick Start](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-language/python/tutorials/quick-start)

**Coverage**: 5-30% of Python knowledge

**What you'll learn**: 12 essential Python concepts through focused touchpoint examples - variables and dynamic typing, functions and lambda expressions, control flow (if/for/while), data structures (lists, dicts, sets), comprehensions, classes and objects, error handling with try/except, modules and imports, file I/O, and basic testing.

**Prerequisites**: Initial Setup complete

**Estimated length**: 750-900 lines

---

### Level 3: Beginner (0-60%)

[Complete Beginner's Guide to Python](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-language/python/tutorials/by-concept/beginner)

**Coverage**: 0-60% of Python knowledge

**What you'll learn**: Comprehensive Python fundamentals including deep dive into dynamic typing, functions and scope, data structures with operations, object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance, exception handling and context managers, file operations (text, JSON, CSV), modules and packages, virtual environments, testing with pytest, and 4 levels of hands-on exercises.

**Prerequisites**: Quick Start recommended (or programming experience)

**Estimated length**: 1,700-2,300 lines

---

### Level 4: Intermediate (60-85%)

[Intermediate Python Programming](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-language/python/tutorials/by-concept/intermediate)

**Coverage**: 60-85% of Python knowledge

**What you'll learn**: Production-grade Python with decorators and descriptors, metaclasses, concurrency patterns (threading, multiprocessing, asyncio), advanced testing with mocking, design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy), performance profiling and optimization, database integration with SQLAlchemy, REST API development with FastAPI, and configuration management.

**Prerequisites**: Beginner tutorial (strong fundamentals required)

**Estimated length**: 1,350-1,700 lines

---

### Level 5: Advanced (85-95%)

[Advanced Python Programming](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-language/python/tutorials/by-concept/advanced)

**Coverage**: 85-95% of Python knowledge

**What you'll learn**: Expert-level topics including Python execution model and bytecode, the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) and its implications, memory management and garbage collection, advanced metaprogramming with AST manipulation, C extensions and Cython, advanced type system (generics, protocols), distributed systems patterns, and advanced debugging strategies.

**Prerequisites**: Intermediate tutorial (mastery of OOP, concurrency, and design patterns required)

**Estimated length**: 1,250-1,500 lines

## 🐍 Python's Philosophy

Python has the gentlest learning curve among general-purpose programming languages. This is intentional - the language prioritizes readability and simplicity. Our tutorials:

- **Teach Pythonic thinking early** (EAFP, duck typing) to build correct mental models
- **Use progressive disclosure** - simple examples before advanced patterns
- **Emphasize readability** over cleverness - Python values explicit over implicit
- **Include many exercises** to reinforce dynamic typing and flexible patterns
- **Show multiple paradigms** - OOP, functional, and procedural approaches
- **Link concepts together** showing how Python's simplicity enables rapid development

The gentle start makes Python ideal for beginners, while the depth supports expert-level work.

## 📖 How to Use These Tutorials

1. **Read sequentially** within each tutorial (sections build on each other)
2. **Type all code examples** yourself - don't copy-paste (builds muscle memory)
3. **Experiment in the REPL** - Python's interactive shell encourages exploration
4. **Complete exercises** before moving to next section
5. **Reference earlier sections** when needed - Python's flexibility has nuances
6. **Use the Cookbook** for quick patterns while learning
7. **Read PEP 8 and PEP 20** to understand Pythonic style and philosophy
