Learn Elixir fundamentals through 30 annotated code examples. Each example is self-contained, runnable in IEx, and heavily commented to show what each line does, expected outputs, and intermediate values.

## Example 1: Hello World and Basic Syntax

Elixir programs run on the BEAM virtual machine (Erlang's runtime). Code can be executed interactively in IEx or compiled from `.ex` files. This example shows the simplest Elixir program and how the compilation pipeline works.

    style Bytecode fill:#029E73,color:#fff
    style VM fill:#CC78BC,color:#fff
    style Output fill:#CA9161,color:#fff
```

**Code**:

```elixir
defmodule Hello do            # => Defines module named Hello
                               # => Modules group related functions
  def world do                 # => Defines public function world/0 (0 arity = no params)
                               # => Public functions callable outside module
    IO.puts("Hello, World!")   # => Calls IO.puts with string argument
                               # => Prints "Hello, World!" to stdout
                               # => Returns :ok atom (success indicator)
  end                          # => Ends function definition
end                            # => Ends module definition

Hello.world()                  # => Calls world function on Hello module
                               # => Output: Hello, World!
                               # => Returns :ok


```

**Key Takeaway**: Elixir code is organized into modules and functions. `IO.puts/1` returns `:ok` after printing, demonstrating Elixir's consistent return value pattern.

**Why It Matters**: Elixir's compilation to BEAM bytecode enables hot code swapping in production—you can upgrade running systems without downtime, a capability inherited from Erlang's telecom roots where five-nines reliability (99.999% uptime) is mandatory. The BEAM VM's preemptive scheduler ensures IO.puts never blocks other processes, allowing WhatsApp-scale systems to handle millions of concurrent connections while maintaining responsive logging across all processes simultaneously.

## Example 2: Variables and Immutability

Elixir variables don't hold values—they **bind** to values. The `=` operator is the **match operator**, not assignment. Once data is created, it cannot be changed (immutability), but variables can be rebound to new values.

**Code**:

```elixir
x = 1                          # => Match operator binds x to value 1
                               # => x is now 1 (type: integer)
x                              # => Returns current binding: 1

x = 2                          # => Rebinds x to new value 2 (old binding discarded)
                               # => x is now 2 (variable rebound, not mutated)
x                              # => Returns current binding: 2

y = 1                          # => Binds y to value 1
                               # => y is 1 (type: integer)
x = 2                          # => Rebinds x again to 2
                               # => x is 2, y is still 1 (independent bindings)

user_name = "Alice"            # => Binds user_name to string "Alice"
                               # => user_name is "Alice" (type: binary/UTF-8 string)
user_age = 30                  # => Binds user_age to integer 30
                               # => user_age is 30 (arbitrary precision integer)

a = b = c = 5                  # => Right-to-left evaluation: c=5, b=c, a=b
                               # => All three variables bound to value 5
a                              # => Returns 5
b                              # => Returns 5
c                              # => Returns 5

list = [1, 2, 3]               # => Binds list to new list structure [1, 2, 3]
                               # => list is [1, 2, 3] (singly-linked list)
new_list = [0 | list]          # => Prepends 0 to list using cons operator |
                               # => Creates NEW list [0, 1, 2, 3] with structural sharing
list                           # => Original list unchanged: [1, 2, 3]
                               # => Immutability: original data never modified
new_list                       # => New list with prepended element: [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

**Key Takeaway**: Variables bind to values (they don't contain values), and data is immutable. You create new data structures instead of modifying existing ones, which enables safe concurrency.

**Why It Matters**: Immutability is foundational to the BEAM's memory model and concurrency guarantees. When data cannot be mutated, multiple processes can safely access the same data without locks or coordination—each process operates on its own copy through structural sharing. The BEAM uses reference counting for binaries and generational garbage collection per process, meaning GC pauses never stop the entire system. This architecture enables Elixir applications to handle millions of concurrent operations without the synchronization overhead that plagues mutable-state languages.

## Example 3: Basic Data Types

Elixir has several basic types: integers, floats, booleans, atoms, and strings. Atoms are constants where their name is their value. Strings are UTF-8 encoded binaries.

**Code**:

```elixir
integer = 42                   # => Binds integer to value 42
                               # => integer is 42 (type: integer, arbitrary precision)
                               # => Integers can be arbitrarily large (no overflow)
large_integer = 1_000_000_000_000  # => Underscores for readability (ignored by compiler)
                                    # => large_integer is 1000000000000 (1 trillion)
                                    # => Underscores can appear anywhere in number
hex = 0x1F                     # => Hexadecimal literal (0x prefix)
                               # => hex is 31 (decimal equivalent)
                               # => 1F in hex = 1×16 + 15 = 31
binary = 0b1010                # => Binary literal (0b prefix)
                               # => binary is 10 (decimal equivalent)
                               # => 1010 in binary = 8 + 2 = 10

float = 3.14                   # => Floating point number
                               # => float is 3.14 (type: float, 64-bit)
scientific = 1.0e-10           # => Scientific notation (1.0 × 10^-10)
                               # => scientific is 1.0e-10 (very small number)

bool_true = true               # => Boolean literal true
                               # => bool_true is true (type: atom, actually :true)
bool_false = false             # => Boolean literal false
                               # => bool_false is false (type: atom, actually :false)

atom = :hello                  # => Atom literal (constant, name is value)
                               # => atom is :hello (type: atom, stored globally)
atom_with_spaces = :"hello world"  # => Quoted atom syntax for spaces/special chars
                                    # => atom_with_spaces is :"hello world"

string = "Hello, 世界!"        # => UTF-8 string (supports Unicode)
                               # => string is "Hello, 世界!" (type: binary)
multiline = """                # => Triple-quote syntax for multiline strings
This is a                      # => Line 1 of multiline content
multiline string               # => Line 2 of multiline content
"""                            # => Closing triple-quote
                               # => multiline is "This is a\nmultiline string\n" (with newlines)

name = "Alice"                 # => Binds name to string "Alice"
greeting = "Hello, #{name}!"   # => String interpolation with #{...} syntax
                               # => Evaluates name and inserts value
                               # => greeting is "Hello, Alice!"

is_integer(42)                 # => Type check function for integers
                               # => Returns true (42 is an integer)

x = 42                         # => Binds x to integer 42
                               # => x is 42 (type: integer)
x = "hello"                    # => Rebinds x to string "hello" (no type error!)
                               # => x is "hello" (type: binary, dynamic typing allows this)
x = :atom                      # => Rebinds x to atom :atom
                               # => x is :atom (type: atom, variables not typed)

defmodule TypeChecker do       # => Defines module for type checking demonstrations
  def process_number(value) when is_number(value) do  # => Guard: when is_number(value)
                                                        # => Only accepts numbers (int or float)

                               # => Returns formatted string
  end

  def format_value(val) when is_integer(val) do  # => Guard: when is_integer(val)
                                                   # => Second clause: matches integers
    "Number: #{val}"           # => Formats as "Number: <value>"
                               # => Returns formatted string
  end
end                            # => Ends module definition

```

**Dynamic Typing Explained**: Elixir checks types at runtime, not compile time. This gives flexibility—the same variable can hold any type. However, functions expect specific types, so runtime errors occur if you pass the wrong type. Use **guards** (the `when` keyword in function clauses) to enforce type safety and pattern match on multiple type signatures. For complex scenarios, optional type specs with `@spec` (covered in advanced sections) document expected types.

**Key Takeaway**: Elixir is dynamically typed—types are checked at runtime, giving flexibility to work with different types. The basic types are simple and consistent: atoms (`:name`) are efficient constants, strings support UTF-8 and interpolation, and integers have arbitrary precision. Use type checking functions and guards for runtime type safety.

**Why It Matters**: Elixir's UTF-8 native strings and arbitrary-precision integers eliminate entire classes of bugs common in systems languages. The BEAM can handle integers of any size without overflow—critical for financial calculations and cryptographic operations. Atoms are stored globally with O(1) equality checks, making them perfect for message passing between distributed nodes, though you should avoid creating atoms dynamically to prevent atom table exhaustion in long-running systems.

## Example 4: Pattern Matching Basics

The `=` operator is the **match operator**, not assignment. The left side (pattern) is matched against the right side (value). If they match, variables in the pattern are bound to corresponding values. If not, a `MatchError` is raised.

```

**Code**:

```elixir
x = 1                          # => Binds x to value 1
                               # => x is 1 (type: integer)

1 = x                          # => Pattern 1 matches value of x (which is 1)
                               # => Match succeeds, returns 1
                               # => No new bindings (1 is literal, not variable)
                               # => Assertion-style matching: fails if x != 1

{a, b, c} = {1, 2, 3}          # => Tuple pattern {a,b,c} matches tuple {1,2,3}
                               # => Destructures: a=1, b=2, c=3
                               # => Returns matched value {1, 2, 3}
a                              # => Returns 1 (first element)
b                              # => Returns 2 (second element)
c                              # => Returns 3 (third element)

[first, second, third] = [1, 2, 3]  # => List pattern matches list structure
                                     # => Destructures: first=1, second=2, third=3
                                     # => Returns matched value [1, 2, 3]
first                          # => Returns 1 (first element)
second                         # => Returns 2 (second element)
third                          # => Returns 3 (third element)

{:ok, result} = {:ok, 42}      # => Tagged tuple pattern matches
                               # => :ok atom matches, result binds to 42
                               # => Returns {:ok, 42}
result                         # => Returns extracted value: 42

{:ok, _} = {:ok, 42}           # => Underscore _ ignores second element
                               # => :ok atom must match, 42 is discarded
                               # => Returns {:ok, 42}
                               # => No binding for ignored value

{_, _, third} = {1, 2, 3}      # => First two elements ignored with _
                               # => Only third element bound to variable
                               # => Returns {1, 2, 3}
third                          # => Returns 3 (third element extracted)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Pattern matching is Elixir's core feature. The `=` operator matches structures and binds variables, enabling powerful data extraction and validation in one operation.

**Why It Matters**: Pattern matching powers Elixir's "let it crash" philosophy and supervisor trees by enabling early error detection through explicit structure validation. When a pattern doesn't match, the BEAM raises a `MatchError` that supervisor processes can catch and handle through restart strategies—this fail-fast approach prevents corrupted state from propagating. In production systems, pattern matching in function heads creates self-documenting contracts that make invalid states unrepresentable, while supervisors use pattern matching on exit signals to implement sophisticated fault tolerance strategies across process boundaries.

## Example 5: Pin Operator (^)

By default, variables in patterns rebind to new values. The **pin operator** `^` prevents rebinding and instead matches against the variable's existing value.

**Code**:

```elixir
x = 1                          # => Binds x to value 1
                               # => x is 1 (initial binding)
x = 2                          # => Rebinds x to value 2 (default behavior)
                               # => x is now 2
x                              # => Returns current binding: 2

x = 1                          # => Resets x to value 1
^x = 1                         # => Pin operator ^ prevents rebinding
                               # => Matches x's current value (1) against right side (1)
                               # => Returns 1 (no rebinding, just validation)

status = :ok                   # => Binds status to atom :ok

{^status, result} = {:ok, 42}  # => Pattern with pinned status
                               # => ^status matches :ok (first element must be :ok)
                               # => result binds to 42 (second element)
                               # => Returns {:ok, 42}
result                         # => Returns 42 (extracted from tuple)

expected_status = :ok          # => Binds expected_status to :ok at module scope

defmodule Matcher do           # => Defines module Matcher
  def match_value(^expected_status, result) do  # => Function with pinned parameter
                                                 # => ^expected_status pins to outer scope value (:ok)
                                                 # => First arg MUST be :ok for clause to match
    result                     # => Returns result unchanged
  end
end

Matcher.match_value(:ok, 42)   # => Calls match_value with :ok and 42
                               # => First arg :ok matches pinned ^expected_status
                               # => result binds to 42, returns 42

list = [1, 2, 3]               # => Creates list for demonstration
[first | _] = list             # => Destructures list without pinning
                               # => first binds to 1 (head element)
                               # => Returns [1, 2, 3]
first                          # => Returns 1

[^first | _] = list            # => Destructures with pinned first
                               # => ^first matches against current value (1)
                               # => Head of list must be 1 for match to succeed
                               # => Returns [1, 2, 3]
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `^` when you want to match against a variable's current value instead of rebinding it. Essential for validating expected values in pattern matching.

**Why It Matters**: The pin operator is crucial for multi-clause function definitions and GenServer callback implementations. In production, pattern matching with pins validates message shapes at function entry, causing immediate crashes for invalid data rather than silent corruption. This aligns with Elixir's 'fail fast' philosophy—supervisors catch these crashes and restart processes with clean state, preventing cascading failures across the system.

## Example 6: Destructuring Collections

Pattern matching shines when destructuring complex nested data structures. You can extract deeply nested values in a single match operation.

**Code**:

```elixir
[head | tail] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]        # => Head|tail pattern splits list
                                        # => head binds to 1 (first element)
                                        # => tail binds to [2, 3, 4, 5] (rest)
                                        # => Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
head                                   # => Returns 1 (first element)
tail                                   # => Returns [2, 3, 4, 5] (remaining list)

[first, second | rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # => Extracts first two explicitly
                                           # => first binds to 1
                                           # => second binds to 2
                                           # => rest binds to [3, 4, 5]
                                           # => Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
first                                  # => Returns 1
second                                 # => Returns 2
rest                                   # => Returns [3, 4, 5] (remaining elements)

[head | tail] = [1]                    # => Matches single-element list
                                        # => head binds to 1
                                        # => tail binds to [] (empty list, no more elements)
                                        # => Returns [1]
head                                   # => Returns 1
tail                                   # => Returns [] (empty list)

user = {"Alice", 30, {:address, "123 Main St", "NYC"}}  # => Creates nested tuple
                                                         # => user is 3-element tuple with nested address tuple
{name, age, {:address, street, city}} = user  # => Destructures nested structure in one operation
                                               # => name binds to "Alice"
                                               # => age binds to 30
                                               # => Nested {:address, street, city} matches {:address, "123 Main St", "NYC"}
                                               # => street binds to "123 Main St"
                                               # => city binds to "NYC"
                                               # => Returns original tuple
name                                   # => Returns "Alice"
age                                    # => Returns 30
street                                 # => Returns "123 Main St"
city                                   # => Returns "NYC"

user_map = %{name: "Bob", age: 25, city: "SF"}  # => Creates map with atom keys
                                                 # => user_map is %{age: 25, city: "SF", name: "Bob"}
%{name: user_name, city: user_city} = user_map  # => Map pattern extracts specific keys
                                                 # => user_name binds to value at :name ("Bob")
                                                 # => user_city binds to value at :city ("SF")
                                                 # => :age key ignored (not in pattern)
                                                 # => Returns original map
user_name                              # => Returns "Bob"
user_city                              # => Returns "SF"

nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]      # => Creates list of three 2-element lists
                                        # => nested is [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
[[a, b], [c, d], [e, f]] = nested      # => Nested list pattern matches structure
                                        # => First sublist [1,2]: a=1, b=2
                                        # => Second sublist [3,4]: c=3, d=4
                                        # => Third sublist [5,6]: e=5, f=6
                                        # => Returns [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
a                                      # => Returns 1 (first element of first sublist)
c                                      # => Returns 3 (first element of second sublist)
e                                      # => Returns 5 (first element of third sublist)

response = {:ok, %{status: 200, body: "Success"}}  # => Creates tagged tuple with map
                                                    # => Common HTTP response pattern
{:ok, %{status: status_code, body: body}} = response  # => Matches :ok tag AND map structure
                                                       # => :ok atom must match
                                                       # => status_code binds to 200
                                                       # => body binds to "Success"
                                                       # => Returns original tuple
status_code                            # => Returns 200
body                                   # => Returns "Success"
```

**Key Takeaway**: Pattern matching destructures nested data elegantly. Extract exactly what you need from complex structures in one operation, making code concise and readable.

**Why It Matters**: Elixir lists are implemented as singly-linked lists in the BEAM, making head access O(1) but indexed access O(n)—this design choice optimizes for the functional programming pattern of recursive head/tail processing. The `[head | tail]` destructuring syntax aligns perfectly with this structure, enabling efficient iteration without mutation or index tracking. In production, this means you write recursive algorithms that leverage the BEAM's tail-call optimization naturally, processing millions of elements with constant stack space while maintaining referential transparency for easier reasoning about concurrent systems.

## Example 7: Lists and Tuples

Lists are linked lists (efficient for prepending, linear access). Tuples are contiguous memory arrays (efficient for random access, fixed size). Choose based on access patterns.

    style Tuple fill:#029E73,color:#fff
    style Array fill:#029E73,color:#fff
```

**Code**:

```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3]                       # => Creates linked list [1, 2, 3]

new_list = [0 | list]                  # => Prepends 0 using cons operator |, O(1)
                                        # => new_list is [0, 1, 2, 3]
list                                   # => Original list unchanged: [1, 2, 3]

[1, 2] ++ [3, 4]                       # => Concatenates two lists, O(n)
                                        # => Returns [1, 2, 3, 4]

[1, 2, 3, 2, 1] -- [2]                 # => Removes first occurrence of 2
                                        # => Returns [1, 3, 2, 1]
[1, 2, 3] -- [3, 2]                    # => Removes first 3, then first 2
                                        # => Returns [1]

Enum.at([1, 2, 3], 0)                  # => Accesses element at index 0, O(n)
                                        # => Returns 1
Enum.at([1, 2, 3], 2)                  # => Accesses element at index 2
                                        # => Returns 3

length([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])                # => Counts list elements, O(n)
                                        # => Returns 5

tuple = {1, 2, 3}                      # => Creates tuple (contiguous memory)

elem(tuple, 0)                         # => Accesses element at index 0, O(1)
                                        # => Returns 1
elem(tuple, 2)                         # => Accesses element at index 2, O(1)
                                        # => Returns 3

new_tuple = put_elem(tuple, 1, 999)    # => Creates new tuple with index 1 updated
                                        # => new_tuple is {1, 999, 3}
tuple                                  # => Original tuple unchanged: {1, 2, 3}

tuple_size(tuple)                      # => Returns tuple size, O(1)
                                        # => Returns 3

{:ok, result} = {:ok, 42}              # => Tagged tuple pattern for success
                                        # => result binds to 42
{:error, reason} = {:error, "not found"}  # => Tagged tuple pattern for error
                                           # => reason binds to "not found"
```

**Key Takeaway**: Lists are for sequential access and variable length (prepend is fast). Tuples are for fixed-size data and random access (indexing is fast). Different performance characteristics guide your choice.

**Why It Matters**: Choosing between lists and tuples affects performance at scale. Lists enable efficient streaming through recursive processing (BEAM optimizes tail recursion), while tuples provide O(1) access for small fixed-size data like GenServer state or ETS table entries. Discord uses tuples to represent messages in their Elixir backend, leveraging fast indexed access for timestamp and author extraction across billions of messages daily.

## Example 8: Maps

Maps are key-value data structures (like hash maps or dictionaries in other languages). They're efficient for lookups and updates. Keys can be any type, but atoms are most common.

**Code**:

```elixir
map = %{"name" => "Alice", "age" => 30}  # => Creates map with string keys
                                          # => map is %{"age" => 30, "name" => "Alice"}

map["name"]                            # => Accesses value by string key
                                        # => Returns "Alice"
map["age"]                             # => Returns 30
map["missing"]                         # => Returns nil (no error, safe access)

user = %{name: "Bob", age: 25, city: "NYC"}  # => Creates map with atom keys
                                              # => Atom key syntax: key: value

%{name: "Bob"} === %{:name => "Bob"}   # => Both syntaxes equivalent for atom keys
                                        # => Returns true

user.name                              # => Dot notation for atom keys only
                                        # => Returns "Bob" (raises KeyError if missing)
user.age                               # => Returns 25

Map.get(user, :name)                   # => Safe access function
                                        # => Returns "Bob"
Map.get(user, :missing)                # => Returns nil for missing key
Map.get(user, :missing, "N/A")         # => Provides default value
                                        # => Returns "N/A"

updated_user = %{user | age: 26}       # => Update syntax | for existing keys only
                                        # => updated_user is %{age: 26, city: "NYC", name: "Bob"}
user                                   # => Original map unchanged: %{age: 25, ...}

with_country = Map.put(user, :country, "USA")  # => Adds new key to map
                                                # => with_country is %{age: 25, city: "NYC", country: "USA", name: "Bob"}

without_age = Map.delete(user, :age)   # => Removes key from map
                                        # => without_age is %{city: "NYC", name: "Bob"}

%{name: person_name} = user            # => Pattern matches to extract :name value
                                        # => person_name binds to "Bob"
                                        # => Returns %{age: 25, city: "NYC", name: "Bob"}
person_name                            # => Returns "Bob"

%{name: n, age: a} = user              # => Extracts multiple keys in pattern
                                        # => n binds to "Bob", a binds to 25

nested = %{user: %{profile: %{bio: "Hello"}}}  # => Creates deeply nested map
updated_nested = put_in(nested, [:user, :profile, :bio], "Hi there!")  # => Updates nested value by path
                                                                         # => updated_nested is %{user: %{profile: %{bio: "Hi there!"}}}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Maps are the go-to data structure for key-value pairs. Use atom keys for performance and dot notation convenience. Updates create new maps (immutability).

**Why It Matters**: Maps are the foundation of Elixir's struct system and ETS table storage. The BEAM implements maps as hash array mapped tries (HAMT), providing O(log n) updates with structural sharing—updating nested maps doesn't copy the entire structure. In Phoenix applications, maps represent HTTP params, database rows, and JSON responses, while structural sharing enables zero-copy transformations through complex middleware pipelines.

## Example 9: Keyword Lists

Keyword lists are lists of tuples where the first element is an atom. They look like maps but maintain order and allow duplicate keys. Commonly used for function options.

**Code**:

```elixir
keyword = [name: "Alice", age: 30]  # => Creates keyword list (syntactic sugar)
                                     # => keyword is [name: "Alice", age: 30]
                                     # => Actually list of tuples: [{:name, "Alice"}, {:age, 30}]

keyword === [{:name, "Alice"}, {:age, 30}]  # => Compares keyword syntax vs tuple syntax
                                             # => Both representations are identical
                                             # => Returns true (same structure)

options = [timeout: 1000, timeout: 2000]  # => Keyword list with DUPLICATE keys
                                           # => Maintains insertion order
                                           # => options is [timeout: 1000, timeout: 2000]

  end
end

```

**Key Takeaway**: Keyword lists are ordered lists of `{atom, value}` tuples. Use them for function options where order matters or duplicates are needed. For everything else, use maps.

**Why It Matters**: Keyword lists power Elixir's DSL capabilities through their order preservation and duplicate key support. Phoenix routers, Ecto queries, and GenServer options all rely on keyword lists for flexible configuration. The order guarantees enable pipeline-style transformations where later options override earlier ones, while duplicate keys support middleware-style composition where multiple `:before` hooks can coexist in supervisor child specs.

## Example 10: Anonymous Functions

Functions are first-class values in Elixir—you can assign them to variables, pass them as arguments, and return them from other functions. Anonymous functions use the `fn` syntax or capture operator `&`.

                                # => numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

                                           # => Returns [2, 4]
```

**Key Takeaway**: Functions are values that can be passed around, stored, and returned. The capture operator `&` provides concise syntax. Anonymous functions enable functional programming patterns.

**Why It Matters**: Anonymous functions enable powerful abstraction over iteration and transformation. The BEAM creates closures that capture their environment efficiently—Enum.map with a closure over external data doesn't copy that data per iteration. In production, this enables pipeline transformations where each stage captures configuration without passing it explicitly, while the capture syntax &(&1 \* 2) compiles to highly optimized bytecode for hot paths.

## Example 11: Named Functions in Modules

Named functions are defined in modules using `def` (public) or `defp` (private). They support pattern matching, guards, and default arguments. Multiple clauses enable elegant branching logic.

**Code**:

defmodule Math do              # => Defines module Math (namespace for functions)
  def add(a, b) do             # => Public function add/2 (def = exported)
                               # => Takes 2 parameters: a and b
    a + b                      # => Returns sum of a and b
                               # => No explicit return keyword needed
  end                          # => Ends function definition

                                            # => \\ syntax defines default value

                               # => Stops recursion
  def factorial(n) when n > 0, do: n * factorial(n - 1)  # => Recursive case: n * factorial(n-1)
                                                          # => Guard ensures n > 0

                                                           # => Pattern matches [head | tail]
                                                           # => Processes list recursively

  def divide(_, 0), do: {:error, "division by zero"}  # => First clause: catches division by zero
                                                       # => _ ignores first argument
                                                       # => Returns error tuple

                               # => Returns sum of a and b
end                            # => Ends module definition

Example.func(5)                # => Calls func/1 with 5
                               # => Matches first definition (arity 1)
                               # => Returns 5
Example.func(3, 4)             # => Calls func/2 with 3 and 4
                               # => Matches second definition (arity 2)
                               # => 3 + 4 = 7
                               # => Returns 7
```

**Key Takeaway**: Named functions use pattern matching in function heads, enabling elegant multi-clause logic. Use `def` for public, `defp` for private. Arity (number of arguments) differentiates functions.

**Why It Matters**: The BEAM's hot code reloading mechanism operates at the module level, allowing you to update running production systems without stopping them—a critical feature for high-availability services. When you deploy a new module version, the BEAM keeps both old and new versions in memory simultaneously, automatically migrating processes to the new code on their next function call. This capability requires clear module boundaries and explicit function exports (`def` vs `defp`), enabling zero-downtime deployments and A/B testing in production while maintaining process isolation guarantees across concurrent systems.

## Example 12: Pipe Operator (|>)

The pipe operator `|>` takes the result of an expression and passes it as the first argument to the next function. This enables readable left-to-right data transformations instead of nested function calls.

                              # => Returns "Alice, Bob, Charlie, Dave"

{:ok, value} = {:ok, 42}     # => Pattern matches to extract value
                              # => value is 42

```

**Key Takeaway**: The pipe operator `|>` transforms nested function calls into readable left-to-right data flows. It passes the left side as the first argument to the right side function.

**Why It Matters**: Guard clauses execute at function dispatch time using BEAM-optimized predicates, making type checking and validation nearly free. The BEAM inlines guard expressions into pattern matching, enabling millions of guarded function calls per second. In production systems, guards validate inputs at boundaries (Phoenix controllers, GenServer callbacks) without the overhead of runtime type checking libraries, while compile-time validation catches guard expression errors.

## Example 13: Case and Cond

`case` enables pattern matching on values with multiple clauses. `cond` evaluates multiple conditions and returns the result of the first truthy clause. Both provide structured branching logic.

**Code**:

```elixir
user_status = {:ok, "Alice"}   # => Creates tagged tuple for user status
                                # => user_status is {:ok, "Alice"} (type: tuple)

result = case user_status do   # => Pattern matches on user_status value
                                # => case evaluates clauses top-to-bottom
  {:ok, name} ->                # => First clause: matches {:ok, "Alice"}
                                # => Destructures tuple, name binds to "Alice"
    "Welcome, #{name}!"         # => String interpolation: "Welcome, Alice!"
                                # => This clause returns the interpolated string
  {:error, reason} ->           # => Second clause: expects {:error, _}
                                # => Not matched (tag is :ok, not :error)
    "Error: #{reason}"          # => Would interpolate reason if matched
  _ ->                          # => Catch-all clause for any other value
    "Unknown status"            # => Returns if no other clause matches
end                             # => case expression returns first match result
                                # => result is "Welcome, Alice!" (type: String)
result                          # => Returns "Welcome, Alice!"

                                # => Will classify this number by range

classification = case number do # => Matches number against guard patterns
                                # => Guards enable conditional matching

    "zero"                      # => Not matched (15 ≠ 0)
  n when n > 0 and n <= 10 ->   # => Guard: 0 < n ≤ 10 (15 > 10 is false)
    "small positive"            # => Not matched
  n when n > 10 and n <= 100 -> # => Guard: 10 < n ≤ 100 (TRUE for 15)
                                # => n binds to 15

loan_status                     # => Returns "Eligible for $50k loan"
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `case` for pattern matching on values, `cond` for evaluating multiple conditions. Both require at least one clause to match, providing exhaustiveness checking.

**Why It Matters**: Default arguments enable flexible APIs without function overloading. The compiler generates separate function clauses for each arity, so `start/1` and `start/2` are distinct functions with zero runtime dispatch cost. Phoenix uses this pattern extensively—`conn/3` with default status enables both `conn(conn, 200, body)` and `conn(conn, body)`, while generated clauses maintain backward compatibility as APIs evolve without version fragmentation.

## Example 14: Recursion Basics

Recursion is the primary looping mechanism in Elixir (no while/for loops). A recursive function calls itself with different arguments until reaching a base case. Tail-call optimization prevents stack overflow.

**Code**:

```elixir
defmodule Recursion do           # => Defines module for recursion examples
  def factorial(0), do: 1        # => Base case: factorial(0) = 1
                                  # => Stops recursion (essential!)
  def factorial(n) when n > 0 do  # => Recursive case: n > 0
                                   # => Guard ensures positive input
    n * factorial(n - 1)          # => n × factorial(n-1)
                                   # => Recursively calls with n-1
                                   # => NOT tail-recursive (multiplication after call)
  end

  def factorial_tail(n), do: factorial_tail(n, 1)  # => Public wrapper function
                                                     # => Initializes accumulator to 1

```

**Key Takeaway**: Recursion replaces loops in Elixir. Always provide a base case to stop recursion. Tail-recursive functions (where recursive call is the last operation) are optimized to avoid stack overflow.

**Why It Matters**: The BEAM implements tail-call optimization at the VM level, meaning tail-recursive functions run in constant stack space regardless of iteration count—you can process billions of items without stack overflow. This optimization is critical in concurrent systems where each of millions of processes might perform recursive operations: non-tail-recursive functions consume stack memory proportional to recursion depth, but tail-recursive functions reuse the same stack frame. In production, this enables building reliable data pipelines that handle unbounded streams efficiently, while the BEAM's per-process heaps ensure that even if one recursive process fails, it's isolated from others through supervisor boundaries.

## Example 15: Enum Module Essentials

The `Enum` module provides functions for working with enumerable collections (lists, maps, ranges). Core operations include `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `each`, and many more. Essential for functional data processing.

**Key Takeaway**: `Enum` module is the Swiss Army knife for collections. `map` transforms, `filter` selects, `reduce` accumulates. Chain operations with pipe operator for readable data transformations.

**Why It Matters**: Pipes transform nested function calls into readable left-to-right sequences that mirror data flow. The BEAM compiles pipes to direct function calls with zero runtime cost—there's no pipe operator overhead. In production Phoenix controllers, request processing flows through `conn |> authenticate |> authorize |> render`, making business logic auditable while compile-time checks catch arity mismatches that would be runtime errors in dynamic languages.

## Example 16: Ranges and Range Operations

Ranges represent sequences of integers from start to end. They're memory-efficient (don't store all values) and work seamlessly with Enum functions. Use them for iterations, list generation, and pattern matching.

**Code**:

```elixir
range1 = 1..10                     # => Creates range from 1 to 10 (inclusive both endpoints)
                                   # => range1 is 1..10 (type: Range)
range2 = 1..10//1                  # => Creates range with explicit step of 1
                                   # => Same as 1..10, but step is explicit
                                   # => range2 is 1..10//1
range3 = 10..1//-1                 # => Creates descending range (10 down to 1)
                                   # => Step -1 makes range go backwards
                                   # => range3 is 10..1//-1

                                   # => Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```

**Key Takeaway**: Ranges are memory-efficient sequences perfect for iterations and numeric operations. They work with all Enum functions and support pattern matching with `in` operator.

**Why It Matters**: Modules organize code into namespaces that compile to BEAM modules with hot reload support. The BEAM loads modules atomically—during upgrades, old code serves requests while new code loads, then switches instantaneously without dropped connections. In production, this enables zero-downtime deploys where supervisors detect module changes and gracefully restart child processes with new code while maintaining overall system availability.

## Example 17: String Interpolation Advanced

String interpolation embeds expressions inside strings using `#{}`. Any Elixir expression can be interpolated, and the result is automatically converted to a string. Use it for dynamic string construction.

**Code**:

```elixir
name = "Alice"                     # => Binds name to string "Alice"
                                   # => name is "Alice" (type: String)
"Hello, #{name}!"                  # => String interpolation with #{} syntax
                                   # => Evaluates name and embeds it in string
                                   # => Returns "Hello, Alice!"

first = "Bob"                      # => Binds first to "Bob"
                                   # => first is "Bob"
last = "Smith"                     # => Binds last to "Smith"
                                   # => last is "Smith"
"Full name: #{first} #{last}"      # => Interpolates multiple variables
                                   # => first is "Bob", last is "Smith"
                                   # => Returns "Full name: Bob Smith"

x = 10                             # => Binds x to integer 10

"Sum: #{x + y}"                    # => Interpolates expression x + y
                                   # => Evaluates 10 + 20 = 30
                                   # => Returns "Sum: 30"
"Product: #{x * y}"                # => Interpolates expression x * y
                                   # => Evaluates 10 * 20 = 200
                                   # => Returns "Product: 200"

"Uppercase: #{String.upcase("hello")}"  # => Interpolates function call result
                                         # => String.upcase("hello") returns "HELLO"
                                         # => Returns "Uppercase: HELLO"
"Length: #{String.length("Elixir")}"  # => Interpolates function result
                                       # => String.length("Elixir") returns 6
                                       # => Returns "Length: 6"

user = %{name: "Charlie", age: 25}  # => Creates map with name and age keys
                                     # => user is %{age: 25, name: "Charlie"}

                                         # => user.name is "Charlie", user.age is 25

                                                                     # => status == :active is true
                                                                     # => Evaluates do clause: "Active"

level = 5                          # => Binds level to 5
                                   # => level is 5
"Level: #{case level do            # => Interpolates case expression
  n when n < 5 -> "Beginner"       # => First clause: n < 5 is false (5 not < 5)
  n when n < 10 -> "Intermediate"  # => Second clause: n < 10 is true (5 < 10)

end}"                              # => case returns "Intermediate"
                                   # => Returns "Level: Intermediate"

```

**Key Takeaway**: String interpolation with `#{}` evaluates any Elixir expression and converts it to a string. Use `inspect/1` for complex data structures and escape with `\#{}` when needed.

**Why It Matters**: Module attributes drive compile-time metaprogramming and documentation generation. @moduledoc and @doc integrate with ExDoc to generate searchable HTML documentation, while @spec enables Dialyzer static analysis that catches type errors across module boundaries. In production teams, these attributes make code self-documenting—Hex.pm package docs auto-generate from attributes, while @behaviour declarations enforce protocol contracts at compile time.

## Example 18: List Operators and Head/Tail

Lists support special operators for prepending and pattern matching. The head/tail pattern `[head | tail]` is fundamental to recursive list processing in Elixir.

```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `[head | tail]` for efficient prepending (O(1)) and pattern matching. Avoid `++` for building lists (use prepend + reverse instead). Head/tail destructuring is the foundation of recursive list processing.

**Why It Matters**: Structs provide named fields with compile-time guarantees and O(1) field access. Unlike maps, structs enforce field names at compile time—typos in field access crash at compilation, not production. Phoenix contexts use structs to represent domain entities (User, Post), while Ecto schemas compile structs with type metadata for database mapping. Structural pattern matching on structs creates exhaustive case handling that prevents nil-related bugs.

## Example 19: If and Unless Expressions

`if` and `unless` are macros that evaluate conditions and return values. Unlike many languages, they're expressions (return values), not statements. Use them for simple two-branch conditionals.

**Code**:

```elixir
x = 10                             # => Binds x to 10
                                   # => x is 10 (type: integer)
result = if x > 5 do               # => if expression evaluates condition x > 5
  "Greater than 5"                 # => do clause: x > 5 is true (10 > 5)
                                   # => Returns "Greater than 5"
else                               # => else clause: not evaluated (condition true)
  "Less than or equal to 5"        # => Would return this if x <= 5
end                                # => if expression ends
result                             # => result is "Greater than 5"

if true, do: "Yes"                 # => One-line if with true condition
                                   # => Evaluates do clause
                                   # => Returns "Yes"
if false, do: "No"                 # => One-line if with false condition
                                   # => No else clause provided
                                   # => Returns nil (default for missing else)

if 2 + 2 == 4, do: "Math works", else: "Math broken"  # => One-line if/else
                                                       # => 2 + 2 == 4 is true
                                                       # => Evaluates do clause
                                                       # => Returns "Math works"

unless false, do: "This runs"      # => unless is opposite of if
                                   # => Runs do clause when condition is false
                                   # => false is false, so do clause executes
                                   # => Returns "This runs"
unless true, do: "This doesn't run"  # => unless with true condition
                                      # => Do clause skipped (condition true)
                                      # => Returns nil

unless 5 > 10 do                   # => unless expression evaluates 5 > 10
  "5 is not greater than 10"       # => do clause: 5 > 10 is false
                                   # => Runs when condition false (inverse of if)
                                   # => Returns "5 is not greater than 10"
else                               # => else clause: not evaluated
  "5 is greater than 10"           # => Would return this if 5 > 10 were true

**Key Takeaway**: `if` and `unless` are expressions that return values. Only `false` and `nil` are falsy; everything else is truthy. Use `unless` for negative conditions to improve readability.

**Why It Matters**: Protocols enable polymorphism without inheritance through dynamic dispatch on data type. The BEAM compiles protocol calls to efficient dispatch tables, making String.Chars.to_string/1 work on any type at near-native speed. In production, protocols power Enum (works on lists, maps, streams), Phoenix JSON encoding (Poison/Jason encode any struct), and Ecto database drivers (DBConnection protocol abstracts PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL).

## Example 20: Multiple Function Clauses

Functions with multiple clauses use pattern matching to dispatch to the correct implementation. Clauses are tried top-to-bottom until one matches. This enables elegant branching without if/else.

**Code**:

```elixir
defmodule Math do                  # => Defines module Math

**Key Takeaway**: Multiple function clauses enable pattern-based dispatch. Order matters—place specific patterns before general ones. Use guards for value-based conditions and pattern matching for structure-based branching.

**Why It Matters**: The if/unless/cond expressions compile to pattern matching under the hood, leveraging the BEAM's optimized case dispatch. Unlike imperative if statements, Elixir's if always returns a value, enabling functional composition. In production, this enables transformation pipelines where `conn |> if(admin?, do: show_admin_panel)` returns the conn unchanged or modified, avoiding the temporary variables and mutation that plague imperative code.

## Example 21: Default Arguments

Default arguments provide fallback values when arguments aren't supplied. Define them with `\\` syntax. Functions with defaults generate multiple arities automatically.

**Code**:

                                            # => \\ syntax defines default value

```

**Key Takeaway**: Default arguments use `\\` syntax and are evaluated at call time. When using defaults with multiple clauses, define a function head. Defaults create multiple arities automatically.

**Why It Matters**: Case expressions compile to BEAM's efficient pattern matching instructions with jump tables for constant patterns. Multi-clause cases handle HTTP responses (`{:ok, data}`, `{:error, reason}`) without nested ifs, making error handling explicit and exhaustive. In production APIs, case expressions on database results force developers to handle both success and failure paths, preventing the silent nil propagation that causes cascading failures.

## Example 22: First-Class Functions

Functions are first-class values—they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions. This enables higher-order functions and functional programming patterns.

**Code**:

```elixir
add = fn a, b -> a + b end         # => Creates anonymous function with 2 parameters
                                   # => add is #Function<...> (function reference)

                                   # => 5 + 3 = 8

execute.({:add, 5, 3})             # => Calls function with {:add, 5, 3}
                                   # => First clause matches
                                   # => 5 + 3 = 8

                                   # => Returns 15
```

**Key Takeaway**: Functions are first-class values that can be assigned, passed, and returned. Use `&` for capture syntax. Closures capture surrounding variables. Higher-order functions enable powerful functional patterns.

**Why It Matters**: Recursion with tail-call optimization is the primary iteration mechanism on the BEAM. The compiler converts tail-recursive functions to constant-stack loops equivalent to while/for in imperative languages. In production, this pattern processes unbounded streams—Phoenix handles WebSocket messages recursively, GenServers maintain state through recursive receive loops, and Ecto query streaming processes millions of rows without memory accumulation.

## Example 23: Module Compilation and Loading

Modules are compiled to BEAM bytecode when loaded. Understanding compilation, recompilation, and the code loading process helps with development workflow and debugging.

**Code**:

```elixir
defmodule Example do               # => Defines module Example
  def hello, do: "Hello, World!"   # => Public function hello/0
                                   # => Returns greeting string
end                                # => Ends module definition
                                   # => Module compiled to BEAM bytecode

Example.hello()                    # => Calls hello/0 function
                                   # => Returns "Hello, World!"

Code.ensure_loaded?(Example)       # => Checks if Example module is loaded
                                   # => Returns true (module defined above)
Code.ensure_loaded?(:non_existent)  # => Checks if non-existent module loaded
                                    # => Returns false (module doesn't exist)

Example.__info__(:functions)       # => Introspects module functions
                                   # => Returns list of {name, arity} tuples
                                   # => Returns [hello: 0]
Example.__info__(:module)          # => Gets module name
                                   # => Returns Example

  def version, do: @version        # => Function returns compiled attribute value
                                   # => @version inlined at compile time
end                                # => Ends module definition

Versioned.version()                # => Calls version/0
                                   # => Returns "1.0.0" (compiled constant)

defmodule Example do               # => Redefines module Example (IEx only!)
  def hello, do: "Hi there!"       # => New hello/0 implementation
                                   # => Replaces previous definition
end                                # => Recompilation creates new version

Example.hello()                    # => Calls newly defined hello/0
                                   # => Returns "Hi there!" (new definition active)

end                                # => Module compiled to bytecode

time1 = Compiled.created_at()      # => Calls created_at/0
                                   # => DateTime.utc_now() evaluated at runtime
                                   # => time1 is current timestamp (e.g., 2024-12-23 10:30:00Z)
:timer.sleep(1000)                 # => Sleeps for 1000ms (1 second)
time2 = Compiled.created_at()      # => Calls created_at/0 again
                                   # => DateTime.utc_now() re-evaluated
                                   # => time2 is NEW timestamp (e.g., 2024-12-23 10:30:00Z, same in this case!)

defmodule Lazy do                  # => Defines module Lazy
  @computed_value Enum.sum(1..1000)  # => Module attribute evaluated at compile time
                                      # => Enum.sum(1..1000) computed during compilation
                                      # => Result stored in bytecode

  def value, do: @computed_value   # => Returns pre-computed value
                                   # => No runtime calculation
end                                # => Module compiled with computed value

Lazy.value()                       # => Calls value/0
                                   # => Returns 500500 (pre-computed sum)
                                   # => No Enum.sum called at runtime (already done!)

defmodule MyModule do              # => Defines module MyModule
  def location, do: __ENV__.file   # => __ENV__ macro provides compilation environment
                                   # => .file accesses source file path
end                                # => Returns file path where module defined

:code.all_loaded()                 # => Gets all loaded BEAM modules
                                   # => Returns list of {module, path} tuples

    end                            # => Inner module compiled
    Inner.greet()                  # => Calls Inner.greet/0
                                   # => Returns greeting
  end                              # => Ends function definition
end                                # => Ends Outer module definition

Outer.create_module()              # => Calls create_module/0
                                   # => Defines Outer.Inner module
                                   # => Calls and returns Inner.greet/0 result
                                   # => Returns "Hello from inner!"
Outer.Inner.greet()                # => Calls Inner module directly
                                   # => Module accessible as Outer.Inner
                                   # => Returns "Hello from inner!"

Example.module_info(:exports)      # => Gets module's exported functions
                                   # => Returns list including auto-generated functions
                                   # => Returns [hello: 0, module_info: 0, module_info: 1]

                                   # => Returns "custom value" (compiled constant)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Modules compile to BEAM bytecode when defined. Module attributes are compile-time constants. Use `Code.ensure_loaded?/1` to check loading status. In production, modules are compiled once; in IEx, redefinition is allowed for development.

**Why It Matters**: Ranges are memory-efficient iterators that don't materialize elements until consumed. 1..1_000_000 creates a tiny struct, not a million-element list. In production, this enables pagination (`Enum.slice(1..total_pages, start, length)`) and lazy batch processing where `Stream.chunk_every(1..billion, 10_000)` processes data in constant memory, unlike languages where range(billion) allocates gigabytes upfront.

## Example 24: IEx Basics and Helpers

IEx (Interactive Elixir) is the REPL for running Elixir code interactively. It provides helpers for documentation, introspection, compilation, and debugging.

**Code**:

```elixir
# Basic IEx helpers (run in IEx)

# h - Help for modules and functions
h(Enum) # => Shows documentation for Enum module
         # => Displays module overview and available functions
h(Enum.map) # => Shows documentation for Enum.map/2
             # => Includes examples and parameter descriptions
h(Enum.map/2) # => Same, explicit arity notation

# i - Information about data types
i(42) # => Shows: Term: 42, Data type: Integer, Reference modules: Integer
      # => Useful for understanding value types at runtime
i("hello") # => Shows: Term: "hello", Data type: BitString (binary)
            # => Reveals UTF-8 string representation
i([1, 2, 3]) # => Shows: Term: [1, 2, 3], Data type: List
              # => Lists element count and structure

# v - Retrieve previous results
1 + 1 # => 2 (result stored in history)
v(1) # => 2 (gets result from line 1)
      # => Retrieves by line number
v(1) * 10 # => 20 (reuses previous calculation)

v() # => Gets last result (most recent)
v(-1) # => Same as v() (negative index from end)
v(-2) # => Second-to-last result

# c - Compile file
# c("path/to/file.ex") # => Compiles and loads module into IEx
                        # => Returns list of loaded modules

# r - Recompile module
# r(MyModule) # => Recompiles module from source
               # => Useful for development iteration

# s - Print spec information
defmodule TypedModule do
  @spec add(integer(), integer()) :: integer()  # => Type specification
  def add(a, b), do: a + b                       # => Implementation
end

# s(TypedModule.add) # => Shows type spec: add(integer(), integer()) :: integer()

# t - Print types
# t(String) # => Shows String type definitions and aliases

# b - Print callbacks
# b(GenServer) # => Shows required callbacks: init/1, handle_call/3, etc.

# exports - List module functions
exports(Enum) # => Lists all Enum functions: [at: 2, count: 1, ...]
               # => Number indicates function arity

# imports - Show current imports
imports() # => Shows: Kernel, Kernel.SpecialForms
           # => Modules imported into current scope

# Clear screen
# clear() # => Clears IEx screen (visual cleanup)

# Break out of execution
# Use Ctrl+C twice to exit IEx (safe shutdown)

# Respawn IEx (after crash)
# respawn() # => Restarts IEx session (fresh state)

# pwd - Print working directory
# pwd() # => Shows current directory path

# ls - List files
# ls() # => Lists files in current directory
# ls("lib") # => Lists files in lib/ directory

# cd - Change directory
# cd("lib") # => Changes to lib/ directory

# Flush messages
send(self(), :hello) # => :hello (send message to self process)
send(self(), :world) # => :world (second message queued)
flush() # => Prints: :hello, :world (and removes from mailbox)
         # => Clears process mailbox

# Runtime info
runtime_info() # => Shows system information (BEAM version, etc.)

# Memory info
runtime_info(:system) # => Shows system memory usage statistics

# Load .iex.exs file with custom helpers
# Create ~/.iex.exs with custom functions/imports
# They'll be available in every IEx session

# Example custom IEx config (~/.iex.exs):
# import_file_if_available("~/.iex.exs")
#
# IEx.configure(
#   colors: [enabled: true],
#   default_prompt: "%prefix(%counter)>",
#   alive_prompt: "%prefix(%node)%counter>"
# )
```

**Key Takeaway**: IEx provides powerful helpers for interactive development. Use `h` for docs, `i` for data info, `v` for history, and `c`/`r` for compilation. Configure IEx with `~/.iex.exs` for custom workflows.

**Why It Matters**: Enums provide lazy evaluation and composition through Stream—transformations don't execute until a terminal operation like to_list or into triggers materialization. This enables pipeline optimization where the compiler fuses multiple Stream operations into single-pass iteration. In production ETL pipelines, `File.stream! |> Stream.map(...) |> Stream.filter(...) |> Stream.into(File.stream!)` processes multi-gigabyte files in constant memory.

## Example 25: Boolean and Comparison Operators

Elixir provides boolean operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) and comparison operators (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, etc.). Boolean operators are strict (require booleans), while `&&`, `||`, `!` work with truthy/falsy values.

**Code**:

```elixir
true and true                      # => Boolean and operator (strict)
                                   # => Both true, returns true
true and false                     # => First true, second false
                                   # => Returns false
false or true                      # => Boolean or operator
                                   # => First false, second true
                                   # => Returns true
false or false                     # => Both false
                                   # => Returns false
not true                           # => Boolean not operator
                                   # => Returns false
not false                          # => Returns true

                                   # => Both truthy, returns last value: 2
nil && 5                           # => First falsy (nil), short-circuits
                                   # => Returns nil (doesn't evaluate 5)
false && "never"                   # => First falsy (false), short-circuits
                                   # => Returns false

1 || 2                             # => Relaxed or operator

                                   # => Returns 1 (doesn't evaluate 2)
nil || false || 5                  # => First two falsy, third truthy
                                   # => Returns 5 (first truthy value)
false || nil || "default"          # => Both falsy, evaluates to last
                                   # => Returns "default"

!true                              # => Boolean not (relaxed)
                                   # => Returns false
!false                             # => Returns true

                                   # => Returns true

                                   # => Returns false

                                   # => 1 equals 1, returns true
2 >= 1                             # => Greater than or equal

```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `and`/`or`/`not` for strict boolean logic, `&&`/`||`/`!` for truthy/falsy values. `==` for value equality, `===` for strict type equality. All types are comparable with defined ordering.

**Why It Matters**: String operations on UTF-8 binaries are optimized at the BEAM level through specialized bytecode instructions. String pattern matching compiles to binary pattern matching, enabling parsing without regex overhead. In production, this makes Elixir exceptionally fast at text processing—Phoenix template rendering, JSON parsing, and log processing all benefit from native UTF-8 support that eliminates encoding conversions present in ASCII-native languages.

## Example 26: Truthy and Falsy Values

In Elixir, only `false` and `nil` are falsy—everything else is truthy. This differs from many languages where `0`, `""`, `[]` are falsy. Understanding truthiness is essential for conditionals.

**Code**:

```elixir
if false, do: "Truthy", else: "Falsy"  # => Tests false for truthiness
                                        # => false is falsy (one of two falsy values)
                                        # => else clause executes
                                        # => Returns "Falsy"
if nil, do: "Truthy", else: "Falsy"  # => Tests nil for truthiness
                                      # => nil is falsy (the other falsy value)
                                      # => else clause executes
                                      # => Returns "Falsy"

if true, do: "Truthy"              # => Tests true for truthiness
                                   # => true is truthy

                                   # => Returns "Truthy"

```

**Key Takeaway**: Only `false` and `nil` are falsy; everything else (including `0`, `""`, `[]`) is truthy. Use `||` for default values and `&&` for conditional execution. This differs from many other languages.

**Why It Matters**: List comprehensions compile to optimized recursive functions that the BEAM executes with tail-call optimization. The into: option enables direct construction of maps, sets, or custom collectors without intermediate lists. In production, comprehensions transform database results (`for user <- users, user.active, do: user.email`) with pattern matching filters that execute at native speed, while the BEAM's garbage collector reclaims temporary structures per-process without stop-the-world pauses.

## Example 27: String Concatenation

Strings can be concatenated with the `<>` operator or built with interpolation and IO lists. Understanding performance trade-offs between methods is important for production code.

**Code**:

```elixir
"Hello" <> " " <> "World"          # => String concatenation with <> operator
                                   # => Concatenates three strings: "Hello", " ", "World"
                                   # => Returns "Hello World"

"a" <> "b" <> "c" <> "d"           # => Multiple concatenations (left-to-right)
                                   # => ("a" <> "b") = "ab", ("ab" <> "c") = "abc", etc.
                                   # => Returns "abcd"

first = "Hello"                    # => Binds first to "Hello"
                                   # => first is "Hello"
second = "World"                   # => Binds second to "World"
                                   # => second is "World"
first <> " " <> second             # => Concatenates three strings
                                   # => "Hello" <> " " <> "World"
                                   # => Returns "Hello World"

"Hello, #{name}!"                  # => Same result using interpolation (cleaner!)
                                   # => Returns "Hello, Alice!"

Enum.reduce(1..1000, "", fn x, acc ->  # => INEFFICIENT: builds string in loop
  acc <> to_string(x) <> ","       # => Creates new string each iteration
                                   # => O(n²) complexity (slow!)
end)                               # => Returns "1,2,3,...,1000," (but slow)

iolist = Enum.map(1..1000, fn x -> [to_string(x), ","] end)  # => Creates IO list (efficient)
                                                               # => Each element is list, not concatenated
IO.iodata_to_binary(iolist)        # => Converts IO list to binary in single pass
                                   # => O(n) complexity (fast!)

  def format_title(title, name) do  # => Function with two parameters

  end                              # => Ends function definition
end                                # => Ends module definition

                                        # => Interpolates: "Dr. Smith"
                                        # => Returns "Dr. Smith"

                                   # => Returns <<1, 2, 3, 4>>
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `<>` for simple concatenation, interpolation for readability, and `Enum.join/2` or IO lists for building strings in loops. Avoid repeated `<>` in loops (creates intermediate strings).

**Why It Matters**: Exceptions in Elixir are expensive operations designed for truly exceptional cases, not control flow. The BEAM optimizes the happy path—try/rescue adds minimal overhead when no exception occurs. In production, this enforces the Elixir pattern of returning {:ok, result} or {:error, reason} tuples for expected failures, reserving exceptions for programmer errors (pattern match failures) that supervisors should catch and restart.

## Example 28: List Comprehensions Basics

List comprehensions provide concise syntax for generating lists from enumerables. They combine mapping, filtering, and flattening operations in readable syntax.

**Code**:

```elixir
# Basic comprehension (like Enum.map)
for x <- [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], do: x * 2 # => Generator x iterates list
                                    # => Returns [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Same as Enum.map
Enum.map([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], fn x -> x * 2 end) # => Equivalent functional approach
                                               # => Returns [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Comprehension with filter
for x <- 1..10, rem(x, 2) == 0, do: x # => Filter condition: rem(x, 2) == 0
                                       # => Returns [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] (evens only)

# Multiple filters
for x <- 1..20,
    rem(x, 2) == 0, # => First filter: even numbers
    rem(x, 3) == 0, # => Second filter: divisible by 3
    do: x           # => Both conditions must be true
# => [6, 12, 18] (divisible by both 2 and 3)

# Multiple generators (cartesian product)
for x <- [1, 2], y <- [3, 4], do: {x, y} # => Nested iteration: x outer, y inner
                                          # => Returns [{1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}]

# Nested comprehension
for x <- 1..3, y <- 1..3, do: x * y # => Multiplies each x-y combination
                                     # => Returns [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9]

# Pattern matching in generator
users = [                          # => List of tagged tuples
  {:user, "Alice", 30},            # => Regular user
  {:user, "Bob", 25},              # => Regular user
  {:admin, "Charlie", 35}          # => Admin (different tag)
]

for {:user, name, age} <- users, do: {name, age} # => Pattern {:user, ...} filters
                                                  # => Admin doesn't match pattern
# => [{"Alice", 30}, {"Bob", 25}] (admin filtered out by pattern)

# Comprehension with maps
for {key, value} <- %{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}, do: {key, value * 10} # => Destructures map entries
                                                                 # => Returns [a: 10, b: 20, c: 30]

# Generate map from comprehension
for x <- 1..3, into: %{}, do: {x, x * x} # => into: %{} collects into map
                                          # => Returns %{1 => 1, 2 => 4, 3 => 9}

# String comprehension
for <<c <- "hello">>, do: c              # => Binary generator <<c <- ...>>
                                          # => Returns [104, 101, 108, 108, 111] (UTF-8 codes)

for <<c <- "hello">>, do: <<c>>          # => Wraps each byte in binary

```

**Key Takeaway**: List comprehensions combine generators (`<-`), filters (guards), and transformations. They're more readable than nested `Enum` calls for complex transformations. Use `into:` to specify output collection type.

**Why It Matters**: The with construct combines pattern matching and error handling into a readable sequence that fails fast on the first error. Unlike nested case statements, with enables flat error handling where each step validates inputs before proceeding. In production Phoenix controllers, `with {:ok, user} <- authenticate(conn), {:ok, resource} <- authorize(user, params)` creates audit trails showing exactly which step failed, while the else clause handles errors uniformly without repetitive case nesting.

## Example 29: Tuple Matching and Destructuring

Tuples are fixed-size collections matched by position. Pattern matching on tuples enables elegant error handling with tagged tuples like `{:ok, value}` and `{:error, reason}`.

**Code**:

```elixir
{a, b, c} = {1, 2, 3}              # => Pattern matches tuple with three elements
                                   # => a binds to 1, b binds to 2, c binds to 3
a                                  # => Returns 1
b                                  # => Returns 2
c                                  # => Returns 3

{x, {y, z}} = {1, {2, 3}}          # => Nested tuple pattern matching
                                   # => x binds to 1 (first element)
                                   # => {y, z} matches nested tuple {2, 3}
                                   # => y binds to 2, z binds to 3
x                                  # => Returns 1
y                                  # => Returns 2
z                                  # => Returns 3

{first, _, third} = {1, 2, 3}      # => Pattern matches, ignores middle element
                                   # => first binds to 1
                                   # => _ ignores 2 (underscore convention)
                                   # => third binds to 3
first                              # => Returns 1

```

**Key Takeaway**: Tuples enable fixed-size pattern matching. Tagged tuples like `{:ok, value}` and `{:error, reason}` are idiomatic for error handling. Use pattern matching in function heads for elegant dispatch.

**Why It Matters**: IO operations in Elixir are asynchronous at the BEAM level—IO.puts sends messages to IO device processes rather than blocking the caller. This enables massive concurrency where thousands of processes can log simultaneously without mutex contention. In production systems, structured logging (Logger.info) integrates with centralized logging (DataDog, Splunk) through custom backends that batch and compress logs without blocking application processes.

## Example 30: Range Patterns and Membership

Ranges can be used in pattern matching with guards and membership checks. The `in` operator provides readable range validation, essential for boundary checking.

**Code**:

```elixir

                                   # => Returns true
15 in 1..10                        # => Tests if 15 in range
                                   # => 15 exceeds upper bound 10
                                   # => Returns false
0 in 1..10                         # => Tests if 0 in range
                                   # => 0 below lower bound 1

10 in 1..10                        # => Tests upper bound
                                   # => 10 equals upper bound (inclusive!)

**Key Takeaway**: Use `in` operator for readable range membership checks. Combine ranges with guards for elegant boundary validation. Ranges are inclusive of both endpoints.

**Why It Matters**: File operations in Elixir leverage the BEAM's binary handling and streaming capabilities. File.stream! returns a lazy stream that reads chunks on demand, enabling processing of files larger than available RAM. In production data pipelines, this pattern processes multi-gigabyte CSV files in constant memory, while the BEAM's per-process heaps ensure file handles are garbage collected when processes crash, preventing resource leaks that plague imperative languages.
