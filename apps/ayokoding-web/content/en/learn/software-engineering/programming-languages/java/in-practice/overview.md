## What is In-Practice Content?

In-practice content provides **conceptual guidance** for applying Java knowledge in real-world development scenarios. This section bridges the gap between learning syntax and building robust, maintainable applications.

## Focus Areas

### Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid in Java development. Learn to recognize problematic patterns before they become ingrained in your codebase.

**Topics covered:**

- Concurrency anti-patterns (thread leakage, race conditions, deadlocks)
- Resource management mistakes (unclosed resources, connection leaks)
- Design anti-patterns (god classes, primitive obsession, shotgun surgery)
- Performance anti-patterns (N+1 queries, premature optimization)
- Security anti-patterns (input validation, credential management)

### Integration Patterns

Working with external systems and data formats in production applications.

**Topics covered:**

- JSON processing with Jackson and alternatives
- SQL database integration with JDBC and connection pooling
- REST API client patterns
- Transaction management and data integrity

### Application Development

Building complete applications with Java.

**Topics covered:**

- Command-line applications with argument parsing
- Configuration management and exit codes
- Native compilation with GraalVM
- Testing strategies for different application types

### Future Topics

Additional in-practice content will cover:

- Best practices and idioms
- Design patterns in Java
- Performance optimization approaches

## How This Differs from By-Example

**In-practice content:**

- Focuses on **conceptual understanding** and **why** patterns emerge
- Uses illustrative code examples to show problems and solutions
- Emphasizes problem/solution format and comparison tables
- More narrative and explanatory

**By-example tutorials:**

- Focuses on **code-first learning** with heavy annotations
- Uses 1-2.25 comment density per code line
- Emphasizes incremental skill building through examples
- More code-centric and practical

## Getting the Most from In-Practice Content

1. **Read actively**: Consider how anti-patterns might appear in your code
2. **Compare examples**: Study both problematic and corrected versions
3. **Apply to your work**: Identify potential issues in existing codebases
4. **Cross-reference**: Link to by-example tutorials for syntax details
5. **Practice recognition**: Learn to spot patterns during code review
