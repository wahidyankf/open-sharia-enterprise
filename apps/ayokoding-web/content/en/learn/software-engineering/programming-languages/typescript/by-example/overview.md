## What is By-Example?

**By-example tutorials** are a code-first learning path designed for experienced developers who want rapid language pickup through heavily annotated working code examples.

**Target Audience**: Seasonal programmers and software engineers who:

- Already know at least one programming language well
- Want quick TypeScript pickup without extensive narrative
- Prefer learning through working code
- Need 95% coverage efficiently

## How This Tutorial Works

**Code-First Approach**: Show the code first, run it second, understand through direct interaction.

**85 Heavily Annotated Examples**: Each example uses `// =>` notation to document values, states, outputs, and side effects at every significant line.

**Five-Part Structure** (per example):

1. **Brief Explanation** (2-3 sentences): What this example demonstrates
2. **Mermaid Diagram** (when appropriate): Visual concept representation
3. **Heavily Annotated Code**: Self-contained, runnable example
4. **Key Takeaway** (1-2 sentences): Core insight summary
5. **Why It Matters** (50-100 words): Production relevance

**Self-Contained Examples**: Every example is copy-paste-runnable within its chapter scope. No external dependencies or references to previous examples.

**95% Coverage**: This tutorial covers 95% of TypeScript features needed for production work through three difficulty levels:

- **Beginner (Examples 1-30)**: 0-40% coverage - Types, functions, interfaces, classes
- **Intermediate (Examples 31-60)**: 40-75% coverage - Generics, utility types, decorators, async
- **Advanced (Examples 61-85)**: 75-95% coverage - Advanced types, compiler API, optimization

## What By-Example Is NOT

**NOT a replacement for**:

- Beginner tutorials (which provide deep explanations for complete beginners)
- Quick Start (which is 5-30% coverage touchpoints)
- Cookbook (which is problem-solving oriented, not learning-oriented)

## TypeScript By-Example vs By-Concept

**Two complementary learning paths**:

| Path           | Approach                                     | Target Audience         | Coverage                |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **By-Example** | Code-first, heavily annotated examples       | Experienced developers  | 95% through 85 examples |
| **By-Concept** | Narrative-driven, comprehensive explanations | Beginners to TypeScript | 95% through deep dives  |

**Choose By-Example if**:

- You know JavaScript well and want rapid TypeScript pickup
- You prefer learning through working code
- You want comprehensive coverage quickly

**Choose By-Concept if**:

- You're new to TypeScript or type systems
- You prefer detailed explanations and context
- You want deep understanding of design decisions

## How to Use This Tutorial

**Sequential Reading**: Examples progress from fundamental syntax to expert mastery. Read in order for best results.

**Copy-Paste-Run**: Every example is self-contained. Copy code into a `.ts` file, compile with `tsc filename.ts`, run with `node filename.js`.

**Annotation Focus**: Pay attention to `// =>` comments showing values, states, and outputs at each step.

**Diagram Study**: Complex examples include Mermaid diagrams visualizing data flow, state transitions, or memory layout.

**Production Context**: "Why It Matters" sections connect concepts to real-world production usage across different frameworks and applications.

## Prerequisites

**Required**:

- Proficiency in at least one programming language
- Basic understanding of JavaScript
- Node.js and TypeScript installed (see [Initial Setup](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript/tutorials/initial-setup))

**Helpful but not required**:

- Experience with object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Understanding of asynchronous programming

## Next Steps

Start with [Beginner Examples](/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript/by-example/beginner) to learn TypeScript fundamentals through 30 annotated examples covering types, functions, interfaces, classes, and more.
