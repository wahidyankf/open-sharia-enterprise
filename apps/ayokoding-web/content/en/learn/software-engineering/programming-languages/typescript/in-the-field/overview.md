**Ready to build production TypeScript systems?** This In-the-Field guide teaches production patterns by following the **Standard Library First** principle, ensuring you understand fundamentals before frameworks.

## What Is "In the Field"?

In-the-Field guides teach production TypeScript development through real-world implementation patterns. Unlike by-example tutorials that achieve 95% language coverage, these guides focus on specific production scenarios using industry-standard frameworks, libraries, and enterprise patterns.

**Key distinction**: By-example taught TypeScript through code. In-the-field teaches **how to build production systems** with TypeScript.

## Standard Library First Philosophy

TypeScript builds on JavaScript's standard library while adding type safety. The progression teaches built-in capabilities before introducing frameworks:

- **Testing** (`assert`) - Built-in testing before Jest/Vitest
- **HTTP servers** (`http` module) - Node.js built-ins before Express/Fastify
- **Build tools** (`tsc` compiler) - TypeScript compiler before esbuild/Vite
- **Logging** (`console`) - Console methods before Winston/Pino
- **JSON handling** (native `JSON`) - Built-in parsing before validation libraries

**Our Approach**: Learn the standard library first, understand when it's insufficient, then adopt frameworks with full knowledge of trade-offs.

### Why This Matters

1. **Foundation understanding** - Know primitives before abstractions
2. **Informed framework selection** - Understand problems frameworks solve
3. **Problem awareness** - See manual implementation complexity
4. **Framework independence** - Core knowledge transfers across tools
5. **Trade-off comprehension** - Recognize when frameworks add value vs overhead
6. **Debugging capability** - Understand what frameworks do under the hood
7. **Optimization skills** - Recognize performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
8. **Production disaster prevention** - Avoid memory leaks, type issues, performance problems from framework misuse

## Progressive Learning Path

Each guide follows this structure:

1. **Why It Matters** - Production context and real-world scenarios
2. **Standard Library First** - Built-in approach with annotated examples
3. **Limitations** - When standard library insufficient for production
4. **Production Framework** - Industry-standard solutions with examples
5. **Trade-offs** - Clear comparison tables (complexity, learning curve, maintenance)
6. **Best Practices** - Actionable guidance with code examples

### Example Progression (Testing)

```mermaid
%% Color Palette: Blue #0173B2, Orange #DE8F05, Teal #029E73, Purple #CC78BC, Brown #CA9161
graph LR
    A["Standard Library<br/>assert module"] -->|Limitations:<br/>No test runner<br/>No reporting| B["Production Framework<br/>Jest/Vitest"]

    style A fill:#0173B2,stroke:#000,color:#fff
    style B fill:#029E73,stroke:#000,color:#fff
```

**Standard Library**: `assert` module provides basic assertions, but no test organization or reporting.

**Limitations**: No test discovery, no parallel execution, no coverage reporting, manual test invocation.

**Production Framework**: Jest (batteries-included), Vitest (Vite integration), or Mocha (flexible) provide test runners, assertions, mocking, and coverage.

**Trade-off**: Learn `assert` patterns first to understand what testing frameworks abstract away.

## Code Annotation Standard

All code examples maintain **1.0-2.25 annotation density** (comment lines per code line) using `// =>` notation to explain values, states, and outputs.

**Example**:

```typescript
import assert from "assert";
// => Import assert from Node.js standard library
// => No external dependencies required

function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  // => Simple addition function
  // => Takes two numbers, returns their sum
  return a + b;
  // => Returns numeric result
}

assert.strictEqual(add(2, 3), 5);
// => assert.strictEqual checks exact equality (===)
// => Throws AssertionError if 2 + 3 !== 5
// => No output if assertion passes
```

**Density**: 5 code lines, 8 annotation lines = 1.6 density (within 1.0-2.25 target)

## Getting the Most from In-the-Field Guides

1. **Complete by-example first**: Foundation knowledge essential for production patterns
2. **Follow standard library first**: Resist jumping directly to frameworks
3. **Understand trade-offs**: Not every project needs every framework
4. **Practice progressively**: Start with standard library, add frameworks when justified
5. **Compare approaches**: Use comparison tables to inform framework selection
