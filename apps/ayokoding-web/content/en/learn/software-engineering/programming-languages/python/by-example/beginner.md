## Example 1: Hello World and Print

Python's `print()` function outputs text to stdout, supporting multiple arguments, string formatting, and custom separators. It's the most basic way to produce visible output and debug programs.

```python
# Basic print
print("Hello, World!")           # => Calls print() with string argument
                                  # => Output: Hello, World!

# Multiple arguments (space-separated by default)
print("Hello", "Python", "3")    # => print() accepts multiple arguments
                                  # => Separator defaults to single space
                                  # => Output: Hello Python 3

# Custom separator
print("A", "B", "C", sep="-")    # => sep parameter overrides default space
                                  # => Joins arguments with hyphen
                                  # => Output: A-B-C

# Custom end character (default is newline)
print("Same line", end=" ")      # => end parameter overrides default '\n'
                                  # => Sets end character to space
                                  # => Output: Same line (no newline after)
print("continues")                # => Continues on same line
                                  # => Output: continues

# Printing variables
name = "Alice"                    # => name is "Alice" (type: str)
age = 30                          # => age is 30 (type: int)
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age) # => Mixes string literals and variables
                                  # => Automatically converts int to string
                                  # => Joins with space separator
                                  # => Output: Name: Alice Age: 30
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `print()` for debugging and simple output - it accepts multiple arguments with customizable separators and handles automatic type-to-string conversion.

**Why It Matters**: Python's print() serves as both a debugging tool and production logging foundation, with its multiple-argument handling and custom separators enabling quick diagnostic output during development. The sep and end parameters provide flexibility for formatting output without string concatenation overhead. In production systems, understanding print()'s behavior helps developers transition smoothly to proper logging frameworks while maintaining similar output patterns.

## Example 2: Variables and Dynamic Typing

Python uses dynamic typing where variables can reference any type and types are determined at runtime. Variable names are case-sensitive and follow snake_case convention.

```python
# Dynamic typing - no type declarations needed
x = 42                            # => x references integer object 42
                                  # => type(x) is int
                                  # => Type inferred from assigned value
                                  # => No explicit type declaration (unlike Java/C++)
print(type(x))                    # => type() function returns object's class
                                  # => Introspects runtime type
                                  # => Output: <class 'int'>
                                  # => Confirms x is integer type

# Reassign to different type (dynamic typing in action)
x = "now a string"                # => Same variable name, NEW object
                                  # => x now references string object
                                  # => Previous int object (42) eligible for GC
                                  # => type(x) changes from int to str
                                  # => Dynamic typing allows type mutation
print(type(x))                    # => type() called again on same variable
                                  # => Returns different type now
                                  # => Output: <class 'str'>
                                  # => Confirms x is string type now

# Multiple assignment (tuple unpacking)
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3                 # => Right side: tuple (1, 2, 3) created implicitly
                                  # => Left side: unpacking into 3 variables
                                  # => a references int 1 (type: int)
                                  # => b references int 2 (type: int)
                                  # => c references int 3 (type: int)
                                  # => Single line replaces 3 assignments
print(a, b, c)                    # => Outputs all 3 values
                                  # => Output: 1 2 3

# Swap variables (Pythonic idiom - no temp variable!)
a, b = b, a                       # => Right side evaluated FIRST: creates tuple (2, 1)
                                  # => Uses current values: b=2, a=1
                                  # => Left side unpacks: a gets 2, b gets 1
                                  # => a is now 2 (was 1)
                                  # => b is now 1 (was 2)
                                  # => Atomic swap without temp variable
print(a, b)                       # => Outputs swapped values
                                  # => Output: 2 1

# Chain assignment (single object, multiple references)
x = y = z = 0                     # => Right-to-left evaluation order
                                  # => Creates single int object 0
                                  # => z references that object
                                  # => y references that same object
                                  # => x references that same object
                                  # => All three variables point to SAME 0 object
                                  # => id(x) == id(y) == id(z) returns True
print(x, y, z)                    # => All variables output same value
                                  # => Output: 0 0 0
```

**Key Takeaway**: Python's dynamic typing provides flexibility but requires discipline - use descriptive variable names and consider type hints for production code to improve readability and catch errors early.

**Why It Matters**: Dynamic typing enables rapid prototyping and flexible APIs, but comes with the cost of runtime type errors that statically-typed languages catch at compile time. Type hints (PEP 484) bridge this gap by enabling static analysis tools like mypy to catch type errors before deployment while preserving Python's dynamic runtime flexibility. This makes Python suitable for both scripting and large-scale production systems when combined with proper type annotations and testing.

## Example 3: Numbers and Arithmetic

Python supports integers (unlimited precision), floats (IEEE 754), and complex numbers with standard arithmetic operators plus floor division and exponentiation.

```python
# Integer arithmetic
a = 10                            # => a is 10 (type: int)
b = 3                             # => b is 3 (type: int)

print(a + b)                      # => 10 + 3
                                  # => Output: 13 (addition)
print(a - b)                      # => 10 - 3
                                  # => Output: 7 (subtraction)
print(a * b)                      # => 10 * 3
                                  # => Output: 30 (multiplication)
print(a / b)                      # => 10 / 3
                                  # => Always returns float
                                  # => Output: 3.3333... (float division)
print(a // b)                     # => 10 // 3
                                  # => Floor division (truncates decimal)
                                  # => Output: 3 (integer result)
print(a % b)                      # => 10 % 3
                                  # => Modulo operation
                                  # => Output: 1 (remainder)
print(a ** b)                     # => 10 ** 3
                                  # => Exponentiation operator
                                  # => Output: 1000 (10^3)

# Float arithmetic
pi = 3.14159                      # => pi is 3.14159 (type: float)
radius = 5.0                      # => radius is 5.0 (type: float)
area = pi * radius ** 2           # => radius ** 2 first (25.0)
                                  # => Then pi * 25.0
                                  # => area is 78.53975 (π × 5²)
print(f"Area: {area:.2f}")        # => f-string with format spec
                                  # => .2f = 2 decimal places
                                  # => Output: Area: 78.54

# Integer unlimited precision
big = 10 ** 100                   # => 10 to power of 100
                                  # => big is 1 followed by 100 zeros
                                  # => Python ints have arbitrary precision
print(big)                        # => Output: 100000000000... (no overflow!)

# Complex numbers
z = 3 + 4j                        # => z is (3+4j) (type: complex)
                                  # => j suffix denotes imaginary part
print(abs(z))                     # => abs() computes magnitude
                                  # => √(3²+4²) = √25 = 5
                                  # => Output: 5.0 (magnitude)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Python integers have unlimited precision (no overflow), division `/` always returns float, and floor division `//` returns integer quotient - use `/` for mathematical calculations and `//` when you need integer results.

**Why It Matters**: Python's unlimited-precision integers prevent overflow bugs that plague languages with fixed-size integers, making it ideal for financial calculations and cryptography where precision is critical. The distinction between `/` (true division) and `//` (floor division) prevents common gotchas from languages where division behavior depends on operand types. Understanding these fundamentals prevents subtle bugs in production code, especially when migrating from languages with different arithmetic semantics.

## Example 4: Strings and String Methods

Strings in Python are immutable sequences of Unicode characters with rich methods for manipulation, formatting, and searching.

```

```python
# String creation (single or double quotes)
name = "Alice"                    # => name is "Alice" (type: str)
                                  # => Double quotes standard convention
greeting = 'Hello'                # => greeting is "Hello" (type: str)
                                  # => Single quotes functionally identical
                                  # => Use either consistently

# String concatenation
message = greeting + ", " + name  # => + operator concatenates strings
                                  # => Creates new string "Hello, Alice"
                                  # => message is "Hello, Alice"
print(message)                    # => Output: Hello, Alice

# String repetition
laugh = "ha" * 3                  # => * operator repeats string
                                  # => laugh is "hahaha" (type: str)
print(laugh)                      # => Output: hahaha

# String methods (immutable - return new strings)
text = "  Python Programming  "   # => text has leading/trailing spaces
                                  # => text is "  Python Programming  "
print(text.strip())               # => strip() removes whitespace
                                  # => Returns NEW string "Python Programming"
                                  # => Output: Python Programming
print(text.upper())               # => upper() converts to uppercase
                                  # => Returns NEW string "  PYTHON PROGRAMMING  "
                                  # => Output:   PYTHON PROGRAMMING
print(text.lower())               # => lower() converts to lowercase
                                  # => Returns NEW string "  python programming  "
                                  # => Output:   python programming
print(text.replace("Python", "Go"))# => replace() substitutes substring
                                  # => Returns NEW string "  Go Programming  "
                                  # => Output:   Go Programming

# Original string unchanged (immutability)
print(text)                       # => text still has original value
                                  # => Immutability guarantees no modifications
                                  # => Output:   Python Programming

# String splitting and joining
words = "apple,banana,cherry"     # => words is "apple,banana,cherry"
fruits = words.split(",")         # => split() converts string to list
                                  # => Delimiter is comma ","
                                  # => fruits is ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)                     # => Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

joined = "-".join(fruits)         # => join() converts list to string
                                  # => Joins elements with "-" separator
                                  # => joined is "apple-banana-cherry"
print(joined)                     # => Output: apple-banana-cherry

# String formatting (f-strings, Python 3.6+)
age = 30                          # => age is 30 (type: int)
print(f"{name} is {age} years old")# => f-string interpolates variables
                                  # => Evaluates expressions inside {}
                                  # => age auto-converts to string
                                  # => Output: Alice is 30 years old

# Multiline strings
poem = """Line one
Line two
Line three"""                     # => Triple quotes preserve newlines
                                  # => poem is "Line one\nLine two\nLine three"
                                  # => poem is 3-line string (type: str)
print(poem)                       # => Prints each line separately
                                  # => Output: Line one
                                  # =>         Line two
                                  # =>         Line three
```

**Key Takeaway**: Strings are immutable - all string methods return new strings rather than modifying originals. Use f-strings for readable formatting and `split()`/`join()` for transforming between strings and lists.

**Why It Matters**: String immutability guarantees thread safety without locks and enables memory optimizations through string interning, making concurrent Python programs more reliable. The rich set of string methods eliminates need for external libraries for common text processing tasks. F-strings (PEP 498) provide readable, performant formatting that compiles to optimized bytecode rather than runtime string concatenation, making them the preferred choice for production code.

## Example 5: Boolean Logic and Comparisons

Python provides boolean type with `True`/`False` values, comparison operators, and logical operators with short-circuit evaluation.

is_deleted = False                # => is_deleted is False (type: bool)
                                  # => False is a boolean literal (capitalized)

# Comparison operators

```

**Key Takeaway**: Python uses short-circuit evaluation for `and`/`or` operators (stops evaluating once result is determined), and many values are falsy (0, empty strings/lists/dicts, None) - use explicit comparisons when checking for specific values.

**Why It Matters**: Short-circuit evaluation optimizes performance by avoiding unnecessary function calls and prevents errors when accessing potentially undefined values (e.g., `obj and obj.method()`). Python's truthy/falsy semantics enable concise conditional checks but require awareness to avoid bugs when distinguishing between None, 0, and empty collections. Explicit comparisons (`if x is None`) are preferred in production code for clarity and correctness over implicit truthiness checks (`if x`).

## Example 6: Conditional Statements (if/elif/else)

Python uses indentation-based blocks for conditionals with `if`, `elif` (else-if), and `else` keywords. No parentheses required around conditions.

```

**Key Takeaway**: Python requires consistent indentation (typically 4 spaces) for code blocks - use `elif` instead of `else if`, and leverage ternary expressions for simple assignments based on conditions.

**Why It Matters**: Python's indentation-based syntax enforces consistent code formatting across teams and eliminates debates about brace placement that plague C-family languages. The elif keyword (unlike C's else-if) prevents deeply nested conditionals and improves readability in multi-branch decision logic. Ternary expressions provide concise conditional assignment while maintaining readability, reducing boilerplate in initialization and configuration code.

## Example 7: While Loops

The `while` loop repeats a block as long as a condition remains true, with `break` for early exit and `continue` for skipping iterations.

```python
# Basic while loop
count = 0                         # => count is 0 (initialization)
                                  # => Loop counter starts at 0
while count < 5:
    # => Condition: count < 5
    # => Checked before each iteration
    # => Loop body executes while True
    print(f"Count: {count}")      # => Prints current count value
                                  # => Output: Count: 0, Count: 1, ..., Count: 4
    count += 1                    # => Increment counter by 1
                                  # => count becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
                                  # => Loop exits when count is 5 (5 < 5 is False)

# While with break
n = 0                             # => n is 0 (initialization)
while True:                       # => Infinite loop (condition always True)
                                  # => Must use break to exit
                                  # => Useful for event loops
    if n >= 3:
        # => Check exit condition
        # => n >= 3 evaluates to True when n is 3
        break                     # => break exits loop immediately
                                  # => Exits to after while block
    print(f"n: {n}")              # => Prints before break check
                                  # => Output: n: 0, n: 1, n: 2
    n += 1                        # => Increment: n becomes 1, 2, 3
                                  # => When n=3, break executes next iteration

# While with continue
i = 0                             # => i is 0 (initialization)
while i < 5:
    # => Condition: i < 5
    i += 1                        # => Increment FIRST (important!)
                                  # => i becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
                                  # => Increment before continue avoids infinite loop
    if i % 2 == 0:
        # => Check if i is even (remainder 0)
        # => True for i = 2, 4
        continue                  # => continue skips rest of loop body
                                  # => Jumps back to while condition
    print(f"Odd: {i}")            # => Prints only for odd numbers
                                  # => Output: Odd: 1, Odd: 3, Odd: 5
                                  # => Even numbers skipped by continue

# While-else (else executes if loop completes without break)
x = 0                             # => x is 0 (initialization)
while x < 3:
    # => Condition: x < 3
    print(f"x: {x}")              # => Prints x value each iteration
                                  # => Output: x: 0, x: 1, x: 2
    x += 1                        # => Increment: x becomes 1, 2, 3
                                  # => When x=3, condition False, exits to else
else:
    # => else block after while
    # => Executes if loop exits normally (condition False)
    # => Does NOT execute if break used
    print("Loop completed")       # => Output: Loop completed (no break occurred)

# While-else with break (else skipped)
y = 0                             # => y is 0 (initialization)
while y < 10:
    # => Condition: y < 10
    # => Could iterate 10 times normally
    if y == 2:
        # => Early exit condition
        # => True when y is 2
        break                     # => break exits loop immediately
                                  # => Skips else block
    y += 1                        # => Increment (but doesn't reach after break)
                                  # => y becomes 1, 2 (then break)
else:
    # => else block after while
    # => NOT executed because break occurred
    print("This won't print")     # => Skipped (break caused early exit)

# Sentinel-controlled loop
user_input = ""                   # => user_input is "" (initialization)
                                  # => Sentinel value pattern
                                  # => Loop until specific value entered
# Uncomment to test interactively:
# while user_input != "quit":
#     # => Condition: continues until "quit" entered
#     # => Sentinel value is "quit"
#     user_input = input("Enter 'quit' to exit: ")
#     # => Reads user input each iteration
#     print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
#     # => Echoes input back to user
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `while` for indefinite iteration when you don't know the loop count in advance - prefer `for` loops for iterating over sequences. The `while-else` clause is rarely needed but useful when you need to distinguish between normal completion and early exit.

**Why It Matters**: While loops excel for event-driven and sentinel-controlled iteration where the termination condition depends on runtime state rather than collection size. The while-else construct elegantly handles search patterns where else indicates 'not found' without requiring flag variables. However, for loops are preferred in production code when iterating over sequences to avoid off-by-one errors and infinite loops common with manual loop counter management.

    print(f"i: {i}")              # => Output: i: 0, i: 1, ..., i: 4

# Range with start and stop
for i in range(2, 6):             # => range(2, 6) generates 2, 3, 4, 5
    print(f"i: {i}")              # => Output: i: 2, i: 3, i: 4, i: 5

# Range with step
for i in range(0, 10, 2):         # => range(0, 10, 2) generates 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
    print(f"i: {i}")              # => Output: i: 0, i: 2, i: 4, i: 6, i: 8

# Reverse range
for i in range(5, 0, -1):         # => range(5, 0, -1) generates 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
    print(f"i: {i}")              # => Output: i: 5, i: 4, i: 3, i: 2, i: 1

# Iterating over strings
name = "Python"                   # => name is "Python"
for char in name:                 # => Iterates: 'P', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'
    print(char)                   # => Output: P, y, t, h, o, n (one per line)

# Iterating over lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                                  # => fruits is ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:              # => Iterates through each element
    print(fruit)                  # => Output: apple, banana, cherry (one per line)

# Enumerate for index and value
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
                                  # => enumerate yields (0, "apple"), (1, "banana"), (2, "cherry")
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")    # => Output: 0: apple, 1: banana, 2: cherry

# For-else (else executes if loop completes without break)
for i in range(3):
    print(i)                      # => Output: 0, 1, 2
else:
    print("Loop completed")       # => Output: Loop completed

# Nested loops
for i in range(3):                # => Outer loop: 0, 1, 2
    for j in range(2):            # => Inner loop: 0, 1 (for each i)
        print(f"({i}, {j})")      # => Output: (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (2,0), (2,1)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `for` loops for iterating over sequences - `range()` generates numeric sequences efficiently (it's a generator, not a list), and `enumerate()` provides both index and value when needed.

**Why It Matters**: For loops in Python iterate over sequences directly rather than indices, reducing off-by-one errors and improving readability compared to C-style loops. The range() function generates values lazily without creating lists in memory, making it efficient for large iteration counts. Enumerate() eliminates manual index tracking, making code more maintainable and less error-prone than managing separate counter variables.

## Example 9: Lists - Creation and Access

Lists are mutable, ordered sequences that can contain mixed types, support indexing (including negative indices), and slicing.

**Positive Indexing:**

```mermaid
%% Color Palette: Blue #0173B2, Orange #DE8F05, Teal #029E73, Purple #CC78BC, Brown #CA9161
graph TD
    N0["Index: 0<br/>Value: 1"]
    N1["Index: 1<br/>Value: 2"]
    N2["Index: 2<br/>Value: 3"]
    N3["Index: 3<br/>Value: 4"]
    N4["Index: 4<br/>Value: 5"]

    N0 --> N1 --> N2 --> N3 --> N4

    style N0 fill:#0173B2,color:#fff
    style N1 fill:#0173B2,color:#fff
    style N2 fill:#0173B2,color:#fff
    style N3 fill:#0173B2,color:#fff
    style N4 fill:#0173B2,color:#fff
```

**Negative Indexing:**

```mermaid
%% Color Palette: Blue #0173B2, Orange #DE8F05, Teal #029E73, Purple #CC78BC, Brown #CA9161
graph TD
    M5["Index: -5<br/>Value: 1"]
    M4["Index: -4<br/>Value: 2"]
    M3["Index: -3<br/>Value: 3"]
    M2["Index: -2<br/>Value: 4"]
    M1["Index: -1<br/>Value: 5"]

    M5 --> M4 --> M3 --> M2 --> M1

    style M5 fill:#DE8F05,color:#fff
    style M4 fill:#DE8F05,color:#fff
    style M3 fill:#DE8F05,color:#fff
    style M2 fill:#DE8F05,color:#fff
    style M1 fill:#DE8F05,color:#fff
```

Python lists support both positive indexing (starting from 0) and negative indexing (counting from the end starting at -1). Both index systems refer to the same list elements.

```python
# List creation
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]         # => numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (type: list)
                                  # => Lists created with square brackets
                                  # => Elements separated by commas
mixed = [1, "two", 3.0, True]     # => mixed is [1, "two", 3.0, True]
                                  # => Lists can contain mixed types (unlike arrays in Java/C++)
                                  # => Python's dynamic typing enables heterogeneous collections
empty = []                        # => empty is [] (empty list)
                                  # => No elements, length is 0

# Indexing (0-based)
first = numbers[0]                # => first is 1 (index 0)
                                  # => Lists use 0-based indexing (like C/Java)
second = numbers[1]               # => second is 2 (index 1)
                                  # => Accesses second element
last = numbers[-1]                # => last is 5 (negative index from end)
                                  # => -1 means last element (Python feature)
second_last = numbers[-2]         # => second_last is 4
                                  # => -2 means second from end

print(first, last)                # => Prints first and last values
                                  # => Output: 1 5

# Slicing [start:stop:step]
subset = numbers[1:4]             # => Slice from index 1 to 4 (exclusive)
                                  # => Extracts elements at indices 1, 2, 3
                                  # => subset is [2, 3, 4]
print(subset)                     # => Output: [2, 3, 4]

first_three = numbers[:3]         # => Slice from start to index 3 (exclusive)
                                  # => Omitted start defaults to 0
                                  # => first_three is [1, 2, 3]
print(first_three)                # => Output: [1, 2, 3]

last_two = numbers[-2:]           # => Slice from -2 to end
                                  # => Omitted stop defaults to end of list
                                  # => last_two is [4, 5]
print(last_two)                   # => Output: [4, 5]

every_second = numbers[::2]       # => Slice with step of 2
                                  # => Takes every 2nd element (0, 2, 4)
                                  # => every_second is [1, 3, 5]
print(every_second)               # => Output: [1, 3, 5]

reversed_list = numbers[::-1]     # => Slice with negative step reverses
                                  # => Step of -1 iterates backwards
                                  # => reversed_list is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
print(reversed_list)              # => Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

# List length
length = len(numbers)             # => len() returns number of elements
                                  # => length is 5
print(f"Length: {length}")        # => Output: Length: 5

# Membership testing
has_three = 3 in numbers          # => 'in' operator checks membership
                                  # => Linear search O(n) for lists
                                  # => has_three is True (3 exists in list)
has_ten = 10 in numbers           # => Checks if 10 in list
                                  # => has_ten is False (10 not found)
print(has_three, has_ten)         # => Output: True False
```

**Key Takeaway**: Lists support negative indexing (counting from end) and powerful slicing with `[start:stop:step]` syntax - slices create new lists without modifying originals, making them safe for data inspection.

**Why It Matters**: Lists are Python's primary ordered collection with O(1) append and index access but O(n) insertion/deletion in the middle, making them ideal for sequential processing. Negative indexing eliminates fence-post errors when accessing end elements and simplifies reverse traversal patterns. Understanding list mutability is critical in production code to avoid unexpected aliasing bugs where multiple variables reference the same list.

## Example 10: Lists - Modification Methods

Lists are mutable with methods for adding, removing, and modifying elements. All modification methods change the list in-place (return `None`).

```python
# List modification methods
fruits = ["apple", "banana"]      # => fruits is ["apple", "banana"]

# append() - add single element to end
fruits.append("cherry")           # => fruits is ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits)                     # => Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# extend() - add multiple elements
fruits.extend(["date", "elderberry"])
                                  # => fruits is ["apple", ..., "elderberry"]
print(fruits)                     # => Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

# insert() - add element at specific index
fruits.insert(1, "apricot")       # => Insert at index 1
                                  # => fruits is ["apple", "apricot", "banana", ...]
print(fruits)                     # => Output: ['apple', 'apricot', 'banana', ...]

# remove() - remove first occurrence of value
fruits.remove("banana")           # => Removes "banana"
                                  # => fruits is ["apple", "apricot", "cherry", ...]
print(fruits)                     # => Output: ['apple', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

# pop() - remove and return element at index (default: last)
last = fruits.pop()               # => last is "elderberry", removed from list
print(last)                       # => Output: elderberry
print(fruits)                     # => Output: ['apple', 'apricot', 'cherry', 'date']

popped = fruits.pop(1)            # => popped is "apricot", removed from index 1
print(popped)                     # => Output: apricot
print(fruits)                     # => Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date']

# clear() - remove all elements
backup = fruits.copy()            # => backup is ["apple", "cherry", "date"] (shallow copy)
fruits.clear()                    # => fruits is [] (empty)
print(fruits)                     # => Output: []
print(backup)                     # => Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date'] (unchanged)

# Index assignment
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]         # => numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers[0] = 10                   # => numbers is [10, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers[-1] = 50                  # => numbers is [10, 2, 3, 4, 50]
print(numbers)                    # => Output: [10, 2, 3, 4, 50]

# Slice assignment
numbers[1:3] = [20, 30, 35]       # => Replace indices 1-2 with 3 elements
                                  # => numbers is [10, 20, 30, 35, 4, 50]
print(numbers)                    # => Output: [10, 20, 30, 35, 4, 50]

# Sorting
unsorted = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]     # => unsorted is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
unsorted.sort()                   # => unsorted is [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9] (in-place)
print(unsorted)                   # => Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]

# sorted() - returns new sorted list
original = [3, 1, 4]              # => original is [3, 1, 4]
sorted_copy = sorted(original)    # => sorted_copy is [1, 3, 4]
print(original)                   # => Output: [3, 1, 4] (unchanged)
print(sorted_copy)                # => Output: [1, 3, 4]
```

**Key Takeaway**: List methods like `append()`, `remove()`, `sort()` modify in-place and return `None` - use `sorted()` and slicing when you need new lists without modifying originals, and always use `copy()` or `list()` to create independent copies.

**Why It Matters**: List slicing creates shallow copies of subsequences with Pythonic syntax that eliminates explicit loop-based copying, reducing code complexity and potential errors. The step parameter enables efficient reversal and sampling patterns without allocating intermediate collections. Mastering slice notation is essential for idiomatic Python as it appears extensively in data processing, pagination, and windowing operations in production systems.

## Example 11: Tuples - Immutable Sequences

Tuples are immutable ordered sequences, often used for fixed collections of related values. Once created, elements cannot be changed, added, or removed.

```python
# Tuple creation
point = (3, 4)                    # => point is (3, 4) (type: tuple)
                                  # => Tuples use parentheses ()
                                  # => Immutable sequence type
colors = ("red", "green", "blue") # => colors is ("red", "green", "blue")
                                  # => Multiple elements separated by commas
single = (42,)                    # => single is (42,) (comma required!)
                                  # => Trailing comma makes it tuple
                                  # => Without comma, it's just parentheses
not_tuple = (42)                  # => not_tuple is 42 (type: int, NOT tuple!)
                                  # => No comma = just int in parentheses

print(type(point))                # => Output: <class 'tuple'>
print(type(single))               # => Output: <class 'tuple'>
print(type(not_tuple))            # => Output: <class 'int'> (gotcha!)

# Indexing and slicing (same as lists)
first = point[0]                  # => first is 3 (index 0)
                                  # => 0-based indexing like lists
second = point[1]                 # => second is 4 (index 1)
subset = colors[1:]               # => Slice from index 1 to end
                                  # => subset is ("green", "blue")
                                  # => Slicing returns new tuple
print(first, second)              # => Output: 3 4
print(subset)                     # => Output: ('green', 'blue')

# Unpacking
x, y = point                      # => Unpacks point into two variables
                                  # => x gets point[0], y gets point[1]
                                  # => x is 3, y is 4
print(f"x={x}, y={y}")            # => Output: x=3, y=4

# Multiple unpacking
r, g, b = colors                  # => Unpacks three elements
                                  # => r is "red", g is "green", b is "blue"
                                  # => Must match element count
print(r, g, b)                    # => Output: red green blue

# Unpacking with * (rest)
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)         # => numbers is (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
                                  # => Tuple with 5 elements
first, *rest, last = numbers      # => * captures middle elements
                                  # => first is 1 (first element)
                                  # => rest is [2, 3, 4] (middle as list!)
                                  # => last is 5 (last element)
print(first)                      # => Output: 1
print(rest)                       # => Output: [2, 3, 4] (list, not tuple!)
print(last)                       # => Output: 5

# Immutability
try:
    # => Attempt to modify tuple element
    point[0] = 10                 # => Tries to assign to point[0]
                                  # => Tuples are immutable (no item assignment)
except TypeError as e:
    # => Catches TypeError from attempted modification
    print(f"Error: {e}")          # => Output: Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
                                  # => Demonstrates immutability

# Tuple methods (limited due to immutability)
nums = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)            # => nums is (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)
                                  # => Has duplicate values
count_of_twos = nums.count(2)     # => count() returns occurrences
                                  # => count_of_twos is 2 (two 2s in tuple)
index_of_three = nums.index(3)    # => index() returns first occurrence position
                                  # => index_of_three is 2 (3 at index 2)
print(count_of_twos, index_of_three)
                                  # => Output: 2 2

# Tuple as dictionary key (lists can't do this!)
locations = {}                    # => locations is {} (empty dict)
                                  # => Dict needs hashable keys
locations[(0, 0)] = "origin"      # => Tuple as key works! (immutable = hashable)
                                  # => (0, 0) is hashable, can be dict key
locations[(1, 1)] = "diagonal"    # => Another tuple key
                                  # => Lists can't be keys (mutable)
print(locations[(0, 0)])          # => Accesses dict with tuple key
                                  # => Output: origin

# Named tuples (more readable alternative - requires import)
from collections import namedtuple
                                  # => Imports namedtuple factory

Point = namedtuple("Point", ["x", "y"])
                                  # => Creates Point class with named fields
                                  # => First arg: class name
                                  # => Second arg: field names
p = Point(3, 4)                   # => Creates Point instance
                                  # => p.x is 3, p.y is 4
                                  # => Named access more readable than indices
print(p.x, p.y)                   # => Access by field name
                                  # => Output: 3 4
print(p[0], p[1])                 # => Still supports index access
                                  # => Output: 3 4 (backwards compatible)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use tuples for fixed collections where immutability is desired (function return values, dictionary keys) - they're more memory-efficient than lists and signal intent that data shouldn't change. Named tuples provide readability benefits for complex tuple structures.

**Why It Matters**: List methods provide in-place modification (append, extend, sort) versus returning new lists (copy), affecting both performance and correctness in multi-threaded code. The distinction between append (adds single element) and extend (adds multiple elements) prevents common bugs when adding collections to lists. Understanding mutability and return values of list methods is critical for avoiding subtle bugs in production code.

## Example 12: Dictionaries - Key-Value Pairs

Dictionaries store key-value pairs with fast lookup by key. Keys must be immutable (strings, numbers, tuples), while values can be any type.

```python
# Dictionary creation
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}                                 # => person is {"name": "Alice", ...}

# Access by key
name = person["name"]             # => name is "Alice"
age = person["age"]               # => age is 30
print(name, age)                  # => Output: Alice 30

# Access with get() (returns None or default if key missing)
city = person.get("city")         # => city is "New York"
country = person.get("country")   # => country is None (key doesn't exist)
country_default = person.get("country", "USA")
                                  # => country_default is "USA" (default provided)
print(city, country, country_default)
                                  # => Output: New York None USA

# Add or update key-value pairs
person["email"] = "alice@example.com"
                                  # => person has new key "email"
person["age"] = 31                # => age updated to 31
print(person)                     # => Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, ...}

# Delete key-value pairs
del person["city"]                # => "city" key removed
print(person)                     # => Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31, 'email': ...}

removed = person.pop("email")     # => removed is "alice@example.com", key deleted
print(removed)                    # => Output: alice@example.com
print(person)                     # => Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 31}

# Membership testing (checks keys, not values)
has_name = "name" in person       # => has_name is True
has_city = "city" in person       # => has_city is False (deleted earlier)
print(has_name, has_city)         # => Output: True False

# Iterating over dictionaries
scores = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 87, "Charlie": 92}

# Iterate over keys (default)
for name in scores:
    print(name)                   # => Output: Alice, Bob, Charlie

# Iterate over keys explicitly
for name in scores.keys():
    print(name)                   # => Output: Alice, Bob, Charlie

# Iterate over values
for score in scores.values():
    print(score)                  # => Output: 95, 87, 92

# Iterate over key-value pairs
for name, score in scores.items():
    print(f"{name}: {score}")     # => Output: Alice: 95, Bob: 87, Charlie: 92

# Dictionary methods
grades = {"math": 90, "english": 85}
                                  # => grades is {"math": 90, "english": 85}

# update() - merge another dictionary
grades.update({"science": 88, "math": 92})
                                  # => grades is {"math": 92, "english": 85, "science": 88}
print(grades)                     # => Output: {'math': 92, 'english': 85, 'science': 88}

# setdefault() - get value or set default if missing
history = grades.setdefault("history", 80)
                                  # => history is 80 (set because key missing)
math = grades.setdefault("math", 0)
                                  # => math is 92 (key exists, no change)
print(history, math)              # => Output: 80 92
print(grades)                     # => Output: {..., 'history': 80}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Dictionaries provide O(1) average lookup, insertion, and deletion by key - use `get()` instead of `[]` when keys might be missing to avoid `KeyError`, and iterate with `items()` when you need both keys and values.

**Why It Matters**: List comprehensions compile to optimized bytecode that runs faster than equivalent for loops with append(), making them the preferred choice for transforming sequences. The readability of comprehensions improves code maintainability by expressing intent (filter-map operations) more clearly than imperative loops. However, complex nested comprehensions should be avoided in favor of explicit loops for maintainability.

## Example 13: Sets - Unique Collections

Sets are unordered collections of unique elements supporting mathematical set operations (union, intersection, difference).

```python
# Set creation
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}         # => numbers is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (type: set)
                                  # => Sets use curly braces {}
                                  # => Unordered, unique elements
empty_set = set()                 # => empty_set is set() (use set(), NOT {})
                                  # => set() function creates empty set
not_empty_set = {}                # => This is an empty DICT, not set!
                                  # => {} creates dict, not set (gotcha!)

print(type(numbers))              # => type() returns class
                                  # => Output: <class 'set'>
print(type(empty_set))            # => Output: <class 'set'>
print(type(not_empty_set))        # => Output: <class 'dict'> (not set!)

# Duplicate elimination
duplicates = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}   # => Sets automatically remove duplicates
                                  # => Only unique values stored
                                  # => duplicates is {1, 2, 3}
print(duplicates)                 # => Output: {1, 2, 3}

# Set from list (removes duplicates)
list_with_dupes = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
                                  # => List with duplicate values
unique = set(list_with_dupes)     # => set() converts list to set
                                  # => Removes duplicates automatically
                                  # => unique is {1, 2, 3}
print(unique)                     # => Output: {1, 2, 3}

# Add and remove elements
fruits = {"apple", "banana"}      # => fruits is {"apple", "banana"}
                                  # => Initial set with 2 elements
fruits.add("cherry")              # => add() inserts single element
                                  # => fruits is {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
                                  # => Modifies set in-place
print(fruits)                     # => Output: {'apple', 'banana', 'cherry'}

fruits.remove("banana")           # => remove() deletes element
                                  # => fruits is {"apple", "cherry"}
                                  # => Raises KeyError if not found
print(fruits)                     # => Output: {'apple', 'cherry'}

# discard() vs remove() - discard doesn't raise error if missing
fruits.discard("banana")          # => discard() deletes if present
                                  # => No error if element missing
                                  # => Safe removal method
try:
    fruits.remove("banana")       # => remove() raises KeyError if not found
                                  # => "banana" not in set (already removed)
except KeyError:
    # => Catches KeyError from remove()
    print("KeyError: banana not found")
                                  # => Output: KeyError: banana not found

# Membership testing
has_apple = "apple" in fruits     # => 'in' operator checks membership
                                  # => O(1) average time complexity (hash table)
                                  # => has_apple is True
has_banana = "banana" in fruits   # => "banana" not in fruits
                                  # => has_banana is False
print(has_apple, has_banana)      # => Output: True False

# Set operations
a = {1, 2, 3, 4}                  # => a is {1, 2, 3, 4}
b = {3, 4, 5, 6}                  # => b is {3, 4, 5, 6}
                                  # => Sets with overlapping elements

# Union (all elements from both sets)
union = a | b                     # => Pipe operator | performs union
                                  # => Combines all unique elements
                                  # => union is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
union_method = a.union(b)         # => union() method same result
                                  # => More explicit than |
print(union)                      # => Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Intersection (common elements)
intersection = a & b              # => Ampersand & performs intersection
                                  # => Elements present in BOTH sets
                                  # => intersection is {3, 4}
intersection_method = a.intersection(b)
                                  # => intersection() method same result
print(intersection)               # => Output: {3, 4}

# Difference (elements in a but not in b)
difference = a - b                # => Minus - performs difference
                                  # => Elements in a that are NOT in b
                                  # => difference is {1, 2}
difference_method = a.difference(b)
                                  # => difference() method same result
print(difference)                 # => Output: {1, 2}

# Symmetric difference (elements in either set but not both)
sym_diff = a ^ b                  # => Caret ^ performs symmetric difference
                                  # => Elements in a OR b but NOT both
                                  # => sym_diff is {1, 2, 5, 6}
sym_diff_method = a.symmetric_difference(b)
                                  # => symmetric_difference() method same result
print(sym_diff)                   # => Output: {1, 2, 5, 6}

# Subset and superset
small = {1, 2}                    # => small is {1, 2}
large = {1, 2, 3, 4}              # => large is {1, 2, 3, 4}
                                  # => small elements all in large
is_subset = small.issubset(large) # => issubset() checks if all elements in other
                                  # => is_subset is True (small ⊆ large)
is_superset = large.issuperset(small)
                                  # => issuperset() checks if contains all of other
                                  # => is_superset is True (large ⊇ small)
print(is_subset, is_superset)     # => Output: True True
```

**Key Takeaway**: Sets automatically eliminate duplicates and provide O(1) membership testing - use them for uniqueness constraints and mathematical set operations, but remember they're unordered (no indexing) and elements must be immutable.

**Why It Matters**: Tuples provide immutable sequences with lower memory overhead than lists, making them ideal for fixed collections and dictionary keys. Tuple unpacking enables elegant multiple return values and variable swaps without temporary variables, reducing code verbosity. Immutability guarantees make tuples thread-safe and hashable, essential for concurrent programming and using collections as dictionary keys.

## Example 14: Functions - Definition and Calls

Functions encapsulate reusable code blocks with parameters, return values, and default arguments. Python functions are first-class objects.

```python
# Basic function definition
def greet(name):
    """Return a greeting message."""# => Docstring (optional but recommended)
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Function call
message = greet("Alice")          # => message is "Hello, Alice!"
print(message)                    # => Output: Hello, Alice!

# Function with multiple parameters
def add(a, b):
    """Add two numbers and return result."""
    return a + b

result = add(5, 3)                # => result is 8
print(result)                     # => Output: 8

# Default arguments
def power(base, exponent=2):
    """Raise base to exponent (default: 2)."""
    return base ** exponent

square = power(5)                 # => square is 25 (5^2, default exponent)
cube = power(5, 3)                # => cube is 125 (5^3, explicit exponent)
print(square, cube)               # => Output: 25 125

# Keyword arguments
def describe_pet(animal, name):
    """Print pet description."""
    return f"I have a {animal} named {name}"

# Positional arguments
desc1 = describe_pet("dog", "Buddy")# => desc1 is "I have a dog named Buddy"

# Keyword arguments (order doesn't matter)
desc2 = describe_pet(name="Whiskers", animal="cat")
                                  # => desc2 is "I have a cat named Whiskers"
print(desc1)                      # => Output: I have a dog named Buddy
print(desc2)                      # => Output: I have a cat named Whiskers

# Multiple return values (returns tuple)
def min_max(numbers):
    """Return minimum and maximum of a list."""
    return min(numbers), max(numbers)

minimum, maximum = min_max([1, 5, 3, 9, 2])
                                  # => minimum is 1, maximum is 9
print(f"Min: {minimum}, Max: {maximum}")
                                  # => Output: Min: 1, Max: 9

# No return value (implicitly returns None)
def print_greeting(name):
    """Print greeting (no return)."""
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")

result = print_greeting("Bob")    # => Prints "Hello, Bob!", result is None
print(result)                     # => Output: None

# *args for variable positional arguments
def sum_all(*args):
    """Sum any number of arguments."""
    total = 0                     # => total is 0
    for num in args:              # => args is tuple of all arguments
        total += num
    return total

print(sum_all(1, 2, 3))           # => Output: 6
print(sum_all(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))     # => Output: 15

# **kwargs for variable keyword arguments
def print_info(**kwargs):
    """Print all keyword arguments."""
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info(name="Alice", age=30, city="NYC")
                                  # => Output: name: Alice, age: 30, city: NYC

# Combining all parameter types
def complex_func(pos1, pos2, *args, kwarg1="default", **kwargs):
    """Demonstrate all parameter types."""
    print(f"Positional: {pos1}, {pos2}")
    print(f"*args: {args}")
    print(f"kwarg1: {kwarg1}")
    print(f"**kwargs: {kwargs}")

complex_func(1, 2, 3, 4, kwarg1="custom", extra="value")
# => Output: Positional: 1, 2
#    *args: (3, 4)
#    kwarg1: custom
#    **kwargs: {'extra': 'value'}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Functions support default arguments, keyword arguments, and variable arguments (`*args`/`**kwargs`) - use keyword arguments for clarity in calls with many parameters, and remember that default argument values are evaluated once at function definition (use `None` as default for mutable defaults).

**Why It Matters**: Dictionaries provide O(1) average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion, making them the foundation for efficient data storage and caching in production systems. The get() method with default values eliminates KeyError handling boilerplate, improving code readability. Understanding dictionary key requirements (hashable, immutable) prevents runtime errors and guides proper data structure design.

def increment():
    # => Function needs to modify global counter
    global counter                # => Declares intent to use global counter
                                  # => Without this, counter += 1 would error

```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `global` to modify global variables from functions and `nonlocal` for enclosing function scopes - but prefer passing values as parameters and returning results over modifying outer scopes, as it makes functions more testable and reduces coupling.

**Why It Matters**: Dictionary iteration methods (keys(), values(), items()) enable efficient traversal patterns without duplicate lookups, improving both code clarity and performance. Dictionary comprehensions provide concise dictionary construction from sequences, reducing boilerplate for data transformation tasks. Mastering these iteration patterns is essential for data processing pipelines and API response transformation in production systems.

## Example 16: Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are anonymous, single-expression functions often used for short operations passed to higher-order functions.

```python
# Basic lambda syntax: lambda arguments: expression
square = lambda x: x ** 2         # => square is a function object
result = square(5)                # => result is 25
print(result)                     # => Output: 25

# Lambda with multiple arguments
add = lambda a, b: a + b          # => add is a function
sum_result = add(3, 7)            # => sum_result is 10
print(sum_result)                 # => Output: 10

# Lambda in sorted() with key parameter
students = [
    ("Alice", 25, 3.8),
    ("Bob", 22, 3.5),
    ("Charlie", 23, 3.9)
]                                 # => List of (name, age, gpa) tuples

# Sort by age (index 1)
by_age = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[1])
                                  # => by_age sorted by age: Bob(22), Charlie(23), Alice(25)
print(by_age)                     # => Output: [('Bob', 22, 3.5), ('Charlie', 23, 3.9), ('Alice', 25, 3.8)]

# Sort by GPA (index 2)
by_gpa = sorted(students, key=lambda student: student[2])
                                  # => by_gpa sorted by GPA: Bob(3.5), Alice(3.8), Charlie(3.9)
print(by_gpa)                     # => Output: [('Bob', 22, 3.5), ('Alice', 25, 3.8), ('Charlie', 23, 3.9)]

# Lambda with map() - apply function to each element
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]         # => numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
                                  # => squared is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squared)                    # => Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Lambda with filter() - select elements matching condition
evens = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
                                  # => evens is [2, 4]
print(evens)                      # => Output: [2, 4]

# Lambda with reduce() - accumulate values
from functools import reduce

product = reduce(lambda acc, x: acc * x, numbers)
                                  # => product is 120 (1*2*3*4*5)
print(product)                    # => Output: 120

# Comparison: lambda vs regular function
# Lambda version (concise)
is_positive_lambda = lambda x: x > 0

# Equivalent regular function (more readable for complex logic)
def is_positive_func(x):
    """Check if number is positive."""
    return x > 0

print(is_positive_lambda(5))      # => Output: True
print(is_positive_func(5))        # => Output: True

# Lambda limitations - single expression only
# This works:
simple = lambda x: x * 2

# This does NOT work (multiple statements):
# complex = lambda x:
#     y = x * 2
#     return y + 1

# Use regular function for multiple statements
def complex_func(x):
    y = x * 2                     # => Multiple statements require regular function
    return y + 1

result = complex_func(5)          # => result is 11
print(result)                     # => Output: 11

# Lambda in list comprehension (avoid - use comprehension directly)
# Less Pythonic:
squares_lambda = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))

# More Pythonic (list comprehension):
squares_comp = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
                                  # => Both produce [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
print(squares_comp)               # => Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use lambdas for simple, one-line operations passed to higher-order functions like `sorted()`, `map()`, `filter()` - but prefer list comprehensions over `map()`/`filter()` for Pythonic code, and use regular functions with docstrings for anything more complex than a single expression.

**Why It Matters**: Sets provide O(1) membership testing and automatic deduplication, making them essential for uniqueness constraints and efficient lookups in production code. Set operations (union, intersection, difference) express intent more clearly than manual iteration and improve performance for large collections. Understanding when to use sets versus lists prevents performance bottlenecks in applications processing large datasets.

## Example 17: List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide concise syntax for creating lists by transforming and filtering existing sequences in a single readable expression.

```python
# Basic list comprehension: [expression for item in iterable]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]         # => numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (type: list)
                                  # => Source data for transformation
squares = [x ** 2 for x in numbers]
                                  # => Iterates: x=1, x=2, x=3, x=4, x=5
                                  # => Applies: 1**2=1, 2**2=4, 3**2=9, 4**2=16, 5**2=25
                                  # => squares is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] (type: list)
print(squares)                    # => Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Comprehension with condition: [expression for item in iterable if condition]
evens = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
                                  # => Tests each: 1%2!=0 (skip), 2%2==0 (keep), 3%2!=0 (skip), 4%2==0 (keep), 5%2!=0 (skip)
                                  # => Filters to: [2, 4]
                                  # => evens is [2, 4] (type: list)
print(evens)                      # => Output: [2, 4]

# Transform and filter combined
even_squares = [x ** 2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
                                  # => First filters evens: [2, 4]
                                  # => Then squares: 2**2=4, 4**2=16
                                  # => even_squares is [4, 16] (type: list)
print(even_squares)               # => Output: [4, 16]

# Comprehension from string
word = "Python"                   # => word is "Python" (type: str)
                                  # => Strings are iterable (6 characters)
upper_chars = [char.upper() for char in word]
                                  # => Iterates: P, y, t, h, o, n
                                  # => Transforms: P.upper()='P', y.upper()='Y', etc.
                                  # => upper_chars is ['P', 'Y', 'T', 'H', 'O', 'N'] (type: list)
print(upper_chars)                # => Output: ['P', 'Y', 'T', 'H', 'O', 'N']

# Comprehension with range
first_ten_squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11)]
                                  # => range(1, 11) generates: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
                                  # => Squares each: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100
                                  # => first_ten_squares is [1, 4, 9, ..., 100] (10 elements)
print(first_ten_squares)          # => Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]

# Nested comprehension (flattening)
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]] # => matrix is list of 3 lists (type: list of lists)
                                  # => Nested structure: 2D -> 1D conversion
flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]

# Equivalent nested loop for comparison
flattened_loop = []               # => flattened_loop is [] (empty list)
                                  # => Manual approach for comparison
for row in matrix:                # => Outer loop iterates: [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]
                                  # => row variable holds each sublist
    for num in row:               # => Inner loop iterates elements: 1, 2 (first), 3, 4 (second), 5, 6 (third)
                                  # => num variable holds each element
        flattened_loop.append(num)# => Appends: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 sequentially
                                  # => flattened_loop grows: [1], [1,2], [1,2,3], ..., [1,2,3,4,5,6]

# Conditional expression in comprehension
nums = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]          # => nums is [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] (type: list)
                                  # => Mix of negative, zero, positive
absolute = [x if x >= 0 else -x for x in nums]
                                  # => Evaluates: -2>=0? No, use -(-2)=2

                                  # => Three strings to measure
lengths = [len(word) for word in words]
                                  # => Calls len("hello")=5, len("world")=5, len("python")=6
                                  # => lengths is [5, 5, 6] (type: list of int)
print(lengths)                    # => Output: [5, 5, 6]

# Nested list comprehension (2D matrix)
matrix_2d = [[i * j for j in range(1, 4)] for i in range(1, 4)]
                                  # => Outer: i=1, i=2, i=3
                                  # => Inner (i=1): 1*1=1, 1*2=2, 1*3=3 → [1,2,3]
                                  # => Inner (i=2): 2*1=2, 2*2=4, 2*3=6 → [2,4,6]
                                  # => Inner (i=3): 3*1=3, 3*2=6, 3*3=9 → [3,6,9]
                                  # => matrix_2d is [[1,2,3], [2,4,6], [3,6,9]] (3x3 multiplication table)
print(matrix_2d)                  # => Output: [[1, 2, 3], [2, 4, 6], [3, 6, 9]]

# When NOT to use comprehensions (too complex - use loops)
# Bad (hard to read):
# complex = [x if x > 0 else -x for x in range(-10, 10) if abs(x) % 2 == 0 if x != 0]
                                  # => Too many conditions and transformations
                                  # => Difficult to understand intent

# Better (use regular loop for complex logic):
complex = []                      # => complex is [] (empty list)
                                  # => Explicit loop more readable for complex logic
for x in range(-10, 10):          # => Iterates: -10, -9, ..., 8, 9
                                  # => 20 total values
    if x != 0 and abs(x) % 2 == 0:# => Filters: non-zero AND even absolute value
                                  # => Keeps: -10, -8, -6, -4, -2, 2, 4, 6, 8
        complex.append(x if x > 0 else -x)
                                  # => If positive (2,4,6,8): keep as is
                                  # => If negative (-10,-8,-6,-4,-2): negate to positive
                                  # => Appends: 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 2, 4, 6, 8
print(complex)                    # => Output: [10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 2, 4, 6, 8]
                                  # => Clear logic flow beats compact syntax
```

**Key Takeaway**: List comprehensions are more Pythonic and often faster than equivalent loops for simple transformations and filtering - but use regular loops when logic becomes complex enough to hurt readability (if you need comments to explain a comprehension, it's too complex).

**Why It Matters**: Functions enable code reuse and abstraction, reducing duplication and improving maintainability in large codebases. Default arguments provide flexible APIs while maintaining backward compatibility as functions evolve. Keyword arguments improve code readability at call sites, making complex function calls self-documenting without requiring excessive comments.

## Example 18: Dictionary and Set Comprehensions

Python supports comprehensions for dictionaries and sets with similar syntax to list comprehensions, enabling concise creation of these data structures.

```python
# Dictionary comprehension: {key_expr: value_expr for item in iterable}
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]         # => numbers is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (type: list)
                                  # => Source for key-value pairs
squares_dict = {x: x ** 2 for x in numbers}
                                  # => Iterates: x=1, x=2, x=3, x=4, x=5
                                  # => Creates pairs: 1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25
                                  # => squares_dict is {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25} (type: dict)
print(squares_dict)               # => Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

# Dictionary comprehension with condition
even_squares = {x: x ** 2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0}
                                  # => Filters: 1%2=1 (skip), 2%2=0 (keep), 3%2=1 (skip), 4%2=0 (keep), 5%2=1 (skip)
                                  # => Creates pairs: 2:4, 4:16
                                  # => even_squares is {2: 4, 4: 16} (type: dict)
print(even_squares)               # => Output: {2: 4, 4: 16}

# Dictionary from two lists using zip

                                  # => names is ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"] (type: list)
ages = [25, 30, 35]               # => ages is [25, 30, 35] (type: list)
                                  # => Parallel arrays to combine
people = {name: age for name, age in zip(names, ages)}
                                  # => zip() pairs: ("Alice",25), ("Bob",30), ("Charlie",35)
                                  # => Unpacks each: name="Alice", age=25, etc.
                                  # => people is {"Alice": 25, "Bob": 30, "Charlie": 35} (type: dict)
print(people)                     # => Output: {'Alice': 25, 'Bob': 30, 'Charlie': 35}

# Swapping keys and values
original = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
                                  # => original is {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3} (type: dict)
                                  # => Keys become values, values become keys
swapped = {value: key for key, value in original.items()}
                                  # => original.items() yields: ("a",1), ("b",2), ("c",3)
                                  # => Creates pairs: 1:"a", 2:"b", 3:"c" (value:key)
                                  # => swapped is {1: "a", 2: "b", 3: "c"} (type: dict)
print(swapped)                    # => Output: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}

print(word_lengths)               # => Output: {'apple': 5, 'banana': 6, 'cherry': 6}

# Set comprehension: {expression for item in iterable}

print(even_set)                   # => Output: {2, 4}

# Set comprehension from string (unique characters)
text = "hello"                    # => text is "hello" (type: str)
                                  # => Contains duplicate 'l' characters
unique_chars = {char for char in text}
                                  # => Iterates: 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'
                                  # => Set keeps unique only: 'h', 'e', 'l', 'o'

                                  # => Mixed case, contains spaces
unique_lower = {char.lower() for char in text if char.isalpha()}

# Dictionary comprehension with conditional values

# Nested dictionary comprehension
matrix = {
    i: {j: i * j for j in range(1, 4)}
    for i in range(1, 4)

print(matrix)                     # => Output: {1: {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}, 2: {1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6}, 3: {1: 3, 2: 6, 3: 9}}

# Filtering existing dictionary
grades = {"Alice": 95, "Bob": 72, "Charlie": 88, "David": 65}

                                  # => Filtering students with passing grades
passing = {name: grade for name, grade in grades.items() if grade >= 75}
                                  # => grades.items(): ("Alice",95), ("Bob",72), ("Charlie",88), ("David",65)

print(passing)                    # => Output: {'Alice': 95, 'Charlie': 88}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Dictionary and set comprehensions follow the same pattern as list comprehensions with curly braces - use them for concise transformations of iterables into dicts/sets, and leverage `zip()` for creating dictionaries from parallel sequences.

**Why It Matters**: Arbitrary arguments (\*args, \*\*kwargs) enable flexible APIs and decorator patterns essential for framework development. Keyword-only arguments (PEP 3102) prevent positional argument errors in functions with many parameters, improving code robustness. Understanding argument patterns is critical for designing maintainable APIs and preventing breaking changes as software evolves.

## Example 19: Exception Handling - Try/Except

Python uses try/except blocks to handle errors gracefully, with optional else (runs if no exception) and finally (always runs) clauses.

```

**Key Takeaway**: Always catch specific exceptions rather than bare `except` to avoid masking unexpected errors - use `else` for code that should only run on success, and `finally` for cleanup that must always happen regardless of exceptions (like closing files or releasing locks).

**Why It Matters**: Local scope prevents naming conflicts and makes code easier to reason about by limiting variable visibility to function boundaries. The LEGB rule (Local, Enclosing, Global, Built-in) governs variable resolution and prevents subtle bugs from unexpected variable shadowing. Minimizing global variables improves testability and reduces coupling in production systems.

## Example 20: File I/O - Reading and Writing

Python provides simple file operations with automatic resource management using context managers (`with` statement).

```python
# Writing to a file
def write_example():
    # => Function demonstrates basic file writing
    # => Creates new file or overwrites existing
    with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
                                  # => open("example.txt", "w") creates file handle
                                  # => "w" mode = write (truncates if exists)
                                  # => 'as file' assigns handle to variable
                                  # => Context manager ensures file.close() called automatically
        file.write("Hello, World!\n")
                                  # => Writes 14 characters to file
                                  # => \n adds newline character
                                  # => Returns number of characters written (14)
        file.write("This is line 2.\n")
                                  # => Writes second line (17 characters)
                                  # => Appends to existing content in buffer
        file.write("This is line 3.")
                                  # => Writes third line (16 characters, no newline)
                                  # => Total file size: 47 characters
    # => with block exits here
    # => file.close() called automatically (context manager cleanup)
    # => All buffered data flushed to disk
    print("File written successfully")
                                  # => Confirms write operation completed

                                  # => os.path.exists() returns False
                                  # => Enters else block
# => Output: nonexistent.txt does not exist
# => result is None (no content returned)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Always use context managers (`with` statement) for file operations - they automatically handle closing files even if exceptions occur. Use `"r"`/`"w"`/`"a"` modes appropriately (write truncates, append preserves), and iterate over file objects directly for memory-efficient line-by-line reading.

**Why It Matters**: Lambda functions provide concise function definitions for simple transformations in functional-style operations like map, filter, and sorted. Their single-expression limitation encourages separation of complex logic into named functions, improving code maintainability. However, named functions are preferred in production code for testability and debuggability unless the logic is trivial.

## Example 21: Classes - Basics

Classes define custom types with data (attributes) and behavior (methods). Python uses `self` to reference the instance within methods.

```python
# Basic class definition
class Dog:
    """Represents a dog with name and age."""
    # => Defines new type called Dog
    # => Can create multiple Dog objects (instances)

    def __init__(self, name, age):
        """Initialize dog with name and age."""
        # => __init__ = constructor method
        # => Called automatically when creating instances
        # => self = reference to the instance being created
        self.name = name          # => Create instance attribute name
                                  # => self.name stores name for THIS dog
        self.age = age            # => Create instance attribute age
                                  # => Each dog has its own age

    def bark(self):
        """Make the dog bark."""
        # => Instance method (has self parameter)
        # => Can access instance attributes via self
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"
                                  # => Returns string using this dog's name

# Creating instances
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 3)            # => Calls Dog.__init__(dog1, "Buddy", 3)
                                  # => dog1 is Dog object with name="Buddy", age=3
                                  # => Instance variables: dog1.name, dog1.age
dog2 = Dog("Max", 5)              # => Creates DIFFERENT Dog object
                                  # => dog2.name="Max", dog2.age=5
                                  # => Separate from dog1

# Accessing attributes
print(dog1.name)                  # => Access instance attribute
                                  # => Output: Buddy

                                  # => Output: 5

# Calling methods
print(dog1.bark())                # => Calls bark method on dog1
                                  # => self=dog1, uses dog1.name
                                  # => Output: Buddy says Woof!
print(dog2.bark())                # => Calls bark method on dog2
                                  # => self=dog2, uses dog2.name

                                  # => Output: 150 (discouraged but works)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `__init__` for initialization, `self` to reference instance attributes/methods, and class attributes for shared data - follow conventions like single underscore prefix for "private" attributes (not enforced, just convention) and implement `__str__`/`__repr__` for readable object representations.

**Why It Matters**: Map applies functions to sequences without explicit loops, expressing transformations more declaratively and enabling potential parallel execution optimizations. Filter creates subsequences based on predicates with clearer intent than manual conditional appending. However, list comprehensions are often preferred in modern Python for their readability and equivalent performance.

```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `super()` to call parent class methods, especially `__init__` for proper initialization - inheritance enables code reuse and polymorphism (same interface, different behavior), but prefer composition over deep inheritance hierarchies to avoid complexity.

**Why It Matters**: File context managers guarantee resource cleanup even when exceptions occur, preventing resource leaks that plague manual file handling. The with statement makes resource management patterns explicit and reduces boilerplate compared to try-finally blocks. Understanding context managers is essential for reliable production systems handling files, network connections, and database transactions.

## Example 23: Class Properties and Magic Methods

Properties provide controlled access to attributes, while magic methods (double underscores) enable operator overloading and Python protocol implementations.

**Key Takeaway**: Properties provide clean getter/setter interfaces without explicit method calls - use magic methods to make custom classes integrate seamlessly with Python operators and built-in functions, enabling natural, Pythonic APIs for your objects.

**Why It Matters**: Exception handling enables separation of error paths from happy paths, improving code readability and maintainability. The try-except-else-finally pattern provides fine-grained control over error handling and cleanup logic. However, exceptions should be used for exceptional conditions, not control flow, to maintain performance in production systems.

## Example 24: Modules and Imports

Modules organize code into reusable files, with imports enabling access to functions, classes, and variables from other modules.

```python
# Module: math_utils.py (example structure)
"""
# math_utils.py - Example module structure

def add(a, b):
    '''Add two numbers.'''
    return a + b

PI = 3.14159

class Calculator:
    '''Simple calculator class.'''
    def __init__(self):
        self.result = 0

    def add(self, x):
        self.result += x
        return self.result
"""

print(math.sqrt(16))              # => Output: 4.0
print(math.sin(math.pi / 2))      # => Output: 1.0

# Nested imports
from collections.abc import Iterable

print(isinstance([1, 2, 3], Iterable))
                                  # => Output: True (lists are iterable)

# Module search path

                                  # => Includes: date, datetime, time, timedelta, etc.

# Using datetime example
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

now = datetime.now()              # => now is current datetime
print(now)                        # => Output: 2025-12-29 17:31:19.123456 (example)

tomorrow = now + timedelta(days=1)# => tomorrow is 24 hours from now
print(tomorrow)                   # => Output: 2025-12-30 17:31:19.123456

# Module __name__ attribute

# When script is imported: __name__ == module name

# Example pattern (common in Python scripts):

print(json_string)                # => Output: {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

parsed = json.loads(json_string)  # => parsed is {"name": "Alice", "age": 30} (dict)
print(parsed["name"])             # => Output: Alice

# random examples
print(random.randint(1, 10))      # => Output: Random integer 1-10
print(random.choice(["a", "b", "c"]))
                                  # => Output: Random element from list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
random.shuffle(numbers)           # => Shuffle list in-place
print(numbers)                    # => Output: [3, 1, 5, 2, 4] (example, randomized)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Import only what you need (`from module import specific_item`) to keep namespace clean and code readable - use `if __name__ == "__main__":` to distinguish between running a file directly and importing it, and organize related code into packages with `__init__.py` files.

**Why It Matters**: Custom exceptions provide domain-specific error types that improve error handling clarity and enable targeted exception handling in production systems. Exception hierarchies allow catching broad categories of errors while maintaining specificity for logging and recovery logic. Well-designed exception hierarchies are essential for framework development and library API design.

## Example 25: String Formatting

Python offers multiple string formatting approaches: f-strings (modern, preferred), `.format()`, and `%` formatting (legacy).

```python
# F-strings (Python 3.6+, recommended)
name = "Alice"                    # => name is "Alice" (type: str)
                                  # => Variable for interpolation
age = 30                          # => age is 30 (type: int)
                                  # => Variable for interpolation

# Basic f-string
message = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old"
                                  # => f-string interpolates variables at runtime
                                  # => {name} replaced with "Alice"
                                  # => {age} replaced with 30 (auto-converted to str)
                                  # => message is "My name is Alice and I am 30 years old"
print(message)                    # => Output: My name is Alice and I am 30 years old

# Expressions in f-strings
print(f"{name.upper()}")          # => {name.upper()} calls method inside {}
                                  # => Evaluates "Alice".upper() → "ALICE"
                                  # => Output: ALICE
print(f"Next year I'll be {age + 1}")
                                  # => {age + 1} evaluates expression
                                  # => Computes 30 + 1 = 31
                                  # => Output: Next year I'll be 31

# Formatting numbers
pi = 3.14159265359                # => pi is 3.14159265359 (type: float)
                                  # => Many decimal places to demonstrate rounding

print(f"Pi to 2 decimals: {pi:.2f}")
                                  # => :.2f = format specifier
                                  # => .2 = 2 decimal places (precision)
                                  # => f = float type
                                  # => Rounds 3.14159... to 3.14
                                  # => Output: Pi to 2 decimals: 3.14
print(f"Pi to 4 decimals: {pi:.4f}")
                                  # => :.4f = 4 decimal places
                                  # => Rounds 3.14159... to 3.1416
                                  # => Output: Pi to 4 decimals: 3.1416

# Width and alignment
print(f"{'left':<10}|")           # => :<10 = left-align, width 10
                                  # => "left" padded with 6 spaces on right
                                  # => Total width: 10 characters
                                  # => Output: left      | (6 spaces after "left")

                                  # => "center" (6 chars) padded with 2 spaces each side
                                  # => Output:   center  | (2 spaces before, 2 after)
print(f"{'right':>10}|")          # => :>10 = right-align, width 10

                                  # => Output:      right| (5 spaces before "right")

# Padding with zeros
number = 42                       # => number is 42 (type: int)
                                  # => Two digits, need padding for width 5
print(f"{number:05}")             # => :05 = width 5, pad with zeros
                                  # => 42 becomes 00042 (3 zeros prepended)
                                  # => Output: 00042

# Thousands separator
large = 1000000                   # => large is 1000000 (type: int)
                                  # => One million (hard to read without separators)
print(f"{large:,}")               # => :, adds thousands separator
                                  # => Inserts comma every 3 digits
                                  # => 1000000 becomes 1,000,000
                                  # => Output: 1,000,000

# Percentage
ratio = 0.75                      # => ratio is 0.75 (type: float)

```

**Key Takeaway**: Use f-strings for all new code - they're fastest, most readable, and support inline expressions and formatting. For simple formatting, f-strings with format specifiers (`:width.precisiontype`) handle most needs without external libraries.

**Why It Matters**: Classes encapsulate state and behavior, enabling object-oriented design patterns essential for large-scale software architecture. The **init** method provides initialization logic with validation, preventing invalid object states. Understanding Python's class mechanics is foundational for leveraging frameworks like Django, Flask, and data science libraries.

## Example 26: Iterators and the Iterator Protocol

Python's iterator protocol enables lazy evaluation and memory-efficient iteration over sequences, with built-in support via `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.

```mermaid
%% Iterator protocol flow

    A[Iterable Object] -->|iter#40;#41;| B[Iterator Object]
    B -->|next#40;#41;| C{Has Next Item?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Return Item]
    C -->|No| E[Raise StopIteration]
    D --> B

    style C fill:#DE8F05,color:#fff
    style D fill:#CC78BC,color:#fff
    style E fill:#CC78BC,color:#fff
```

```python
# Built-in iterators
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]         # => numbers is list (iterable)

# Get iterator from iterable
iterator = iter(numbers)          # => iterator is list_iterator object
print(type(iterator))             # => Output: <class 'list_iterator'>

# Manually iterate with next()
print(next(iterator))             # => Output: 1 (first item)
print(next(iterator))             # => Output: 2 (second item)
print(next(iterator))             # => Output: 3 (third item)

# Continue until StopIteration
try:
    print(next(iterator))         # => Output: 4
    print(next(iterator))         # => Output: 5
    print(next(iterator))         # => No more items, raises StopIteration
except StopIteration:
    print("Iterator exhausted")   # => Output: Iterator exhausted

# For loop uses iterator protocol internally
for num in [1, 2, 3]:             # => Calls iter([1,2,3]) then next() repeatedly
    print(num)                    # => Output: 1, 2, 3

# Custom iterator - countdown
class Countdown:
    """Iterator that counts down from start to 0."""

    def __init__(self, start):
        self.current = start      # => current is starting value

    def __iter__(self):
        """Return self (this object is its own iterator)."""

    def __next__(self):
        """Return next value or raise StopIteration."""
        if self.current <= 0:
            raise StopIteration   # => Signal iteration is complete

        self.current -= 1         # => Decrement before returning
        return self.current + 1   # => Return original value

countdown = Countdown(5)          # => countdown starts at 5

for num in countdown:             # => Uses iterator protocol
    print(num)                    # => Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

# Iterator is exhausted after first use
for num in countdown:
    print(num)                    # => Output: (nothing - iterator exhausted)

# Custom iterable - range-like class
class MyRange:
    """Iterable that generates range of numbers."""

    def __init__(self, start, end):

    def __iter__(self):
        """Return a new iterator each time."""
        return MyRangeIterator(self.start, self.end)

class MyRangeIterator:

    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.current = start
        self.end = end

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current >= self.end:
            raise StopIteration
        value = self.current
        self.current += 1
        return value

my_range = MyRange(1, 5)          # => my_range is iterable (1 to 4)

# Can iterate multiple times (new iterator each time)
for num in my_range:
    print(num)                    # => Output: 1, 2, 3, 4

for num in my_range:
    print(num)                    # => Output: 1, 2, 3, 4 (works again!)

# Iterator functions from itertools

# cycle() - infinite cycle through iterable
colors = itertools.cycle(["red", "green", "blue"])
                                  # => Cycles through colors infinitely
print(next(colors))               # => Output: red
print(next(colors))               # => Output: green
print(next(colors))               # => Output: blue
print(next(colors))               # => Output: red (cycles back)

# islice() - slice an iterator
numbers = itertools.count(1)      # => Infinite counter starting at 1
first_five = itertools.islice(numbers, 5)
                                  # => First 5 elements
print(list(first_five))           # => Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# chain() - chain multiple iterables
combined = itertools.chain([1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6])
                                  # => Chains iterables together
print(list(combined))             # => Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# zip() - iterate over multiple sequences in parallel
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
cities = ["NYC", "LA", "Chicago"]

for name, age, city in zip(names, ages, cities):
    print(f"{name}, {age}, {city}")
# => Output: Alice, 25, NYC
#    Bob, 30, LA
#    Charlie, 35, Chicago

# zip stops at shortest iterable
short = zip([1, 2], ["a", "b", "c"])
print(list(short))                # => Output: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')] (stops at 2)

# itertools.zip_longest() - zip to longest iterable
from itertools import zip_longest

long = zip_longest([1, 2], ["a", "b", "c"], fillvalue=0)
print(list(long))                 # => Output: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (0, 'c')]

# enumerate() - get index and value
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
# => Output: 0: apple
#    1: banana
#    2: cherry

# Start enumeration at custom index
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")
# => Output: 1: apple
#    2: banana
#    3: cherry

# reversed() - reverse iteration
for num in reversed([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]):
    print(num)                    # => Output: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

# Memory efficiency demonstration
import sys

# List stores all items in memory
list_range = list(range(1000000)) # => Creates list with 1M items
print(f"List size: {sys.getsizeof(list_range)} bytes")
                                  # => Output: ~8MB (stores all items)

# Iterator generates items on-demand
iter_range = iter(range(1000000)) # => Iterator object (lightweight)
print(f"Iterator size: {sys.getsizeof(iter_range)} bytes")
                                  # => Output: ~48 bytes (just state!)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Iterators enable memory-efficient processing of large sequences by generating values on-demand rather than storing everything in memory - implement `__iter__` and `__next__` for custom iterators, and leverage `itertools` for common iteration patterns without reinventing the wheel.

**Why It Matters**: Inheritance enables code reuse through polymorphism, allowing subclasses to extend and override base class behavior. The super() function provides cooperative multiple inheritance essential for mixin patterns in framework development. However, composition is often preferred over deep inheritance hierarchies for maintainability in production systems.

## Example 27: Basic Error Handling Patterns

Common patterns for handling errors include EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission), LBYL (Look Before You Leap), custom exceptions, and exception chaining.

```python
# EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) - Pythonic
def eafp_example(data, key):
    """Try operation, handle exception if it fails."""
    # => EAFP philosophy: Try first, handle errors later
    # => Pythonic approach for cleaner code
    try:
        # => Attempt operation without checking first
        return data[key]          # => Try to access key in dict
                                  # => If key exists, returns value
                                  # => If key missing, raises KeyError
    except KeyError:
        # => Exception handling catches KeyError
        # => Executes only if key not found
        return "Key not found"    # => Returns default message
                                  # => No exception propagates

data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
                                  # => data is dict with 2 keys
                                  # => Test EAFP approach
print(eafp_example(data, "name")) # => Key "name" exists
                                  # => Returns "Alice" from try block
                                  # => Output: Alice
print(eafp_example(data, "city")) # => Key "city" doesn't exist
                                  # => Raises KeyError in try
                                  # => Caught by except, returns "Key not found"
                                  # => Output: Key not found

# LBYL (Look Before You Leap) - Check before action
def lbyl_example(data, key):
    """Check condition before operation."""
    # => LBYL philosophy: Check preconditions first
    # => More defensive programming style
    if key in data:               # => Check if key exists first
                                  # => Prevents exception from occurring
                                  # => 'in' operator checks membership
        return data[key]          # => Safe access (key confirmed to exist)
                                  # => Returns value for existing key

# EAFP vs LBYL comparison
# => EAFP: More Pythonic, handles race conditions better
#    - Assumes success, handles failures
#    - Single dict access (faster when key exists)
#    - Thread-safe (no TOCTOU race between check and use)
# => LBYL: Clearer for simple cases, but verbose and prone to races
#    - Explicit precondition checking
#    - Double dict access (check + get)
#    - Race condition possible in multithreaded code

```

**Key Takeaway**: Prefer EAFP (try/except) over LBYL (if checks) for Pythonic code - use custom exceptions to provide clear error semantics, implement exception chaining with `raise ... from e` to preserve root causes, and leverage context managers for automatic resource cleanup even when exceptions occur.

**Why It Matters**: Class and static methods provide alternative ways to organize related functionality without requiring instance state. Classmethods enable alternative constructors and factory patterns common in framework design. Understanding method types is essential for designing clean APIs and avoiding inappropriate instance state access in utility functions.
