This section covers production Kotlin patterns from examples 28-54, achieving 40-75% topic coverage.

## Example 28: Basic Coroutines - Launch and RunBlocking

Coroutines enable asynchronous programming without blocking threads. `runBlocking` creates a coroutine scope that blocks the current thread until all child coroutines complete. `launch` starts a fire-and-forget coroutine that runs concurrently.

**Coroutine Builders**:

- **runBlocking**: Blocks the current thread while bridging blocking and suspending code. Use for main functions and tests.
- **launch**: Fire-and-forget coroutine builder that returns a Job. Structured concurrency ensures parent waits for children.
- **delay**: Non-blocking suspension that releases the thread for other work (unlike Thread.sleep).

**Structured Concurrency**: Child coroutines (launched) are tracked by parent scope (runBlocking). If parent cancels, children auto-cancel. Uncaught exceptions propagate to parent and cancel entire scope.

**Thread Behavior**: `delay` suspends the coroutine without blocking the thread. The thread can execute other coroutines during suspension. When the coroutine resumes, it may execute on a different thread from the thread pool.

```mermaid
%% Coroutine execution flow showing suspension without blocking
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as Main Thread
    participant Scope as runBlocking Scope
    participant Coroutine as launch Coroutine
    participant Delay as Delay Scheduler

    Main->>Scope: runBlocking { }
    activate Scope
    Scope->>Coroutine: launch { }
    activate Coroutine
    Coroutine->>Coroutine: println("Starting...")
    Coroutine->>Delay: delay(1000)

    Delay-->>Coroutine: Resume after 1s
    Coroutine->>Coroutine: println("Done")
    deactivate Coroutine
    Scope->>Main: All coroutines complete
    deactivate Scope

```

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
// => Requires 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core' dependency

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // => runBlocking blocks main thread until all children complete

    println("Main starts")
    // => Output: Main starts
    // => T=0ms on main thread

    launch {
        // => launch returns Job, starts child coroutine
        // => Child inherits parent scope (structured concurrency)

        println("Coroutine starts")
        // => Output: Coroutine starts (runs AFTER "Main continues")
        // => T=~0-1ms on dispatcher thread

        delay(1000)
        // => Suspends coroutine, releases thread for other work

        println("Coroutine ends")
        // => Output: Coroutine ends
        // => T=1000ms, may execute on different thread
    }
    // => launch doesn't block - main continues immediately

    println("Main continues")
    // => Output: Main continues
    // => Proves launch is non-blocking

    delay(1500)
    // => Suspends runBlocking coroutine, main thread BLOCKED
    // => Ensures launched coroutine has time to complete

    println("Main ends")
    // => Output: Main ends
    // => T=1500ms on main thread
}
// => Total execution: ~1500ms (longest delay in scope)
```

**Execution Order**:

- T=0ms: "Main starts" (main thread)
- T=0ms: "Main continues" (main thread, launch doesn't block)
- T=~0-1ms: "Coroutine starts" (dispatcher thread)
- T=1000ms: "Coroutine ends" (dispatcher thread)
- T=1500ms: "Main ends" (main thread)

**Key Takeaway**: Use `runBlocking` for bridging blocking and coroutine code, `launch` for fire-and-forget concurrent tasks, and `delay` for non-blocking suspension.

**Why It Matters**: Coroutines solve the thread-blocking problem that cripples Java's traditional concurrency model, where thread-per-request architectures waste memory (each thread costs 1MB stack) and context switching overhead destroys throughput under load. Kotlin's suspend functions enable async/await patterns with zero thread allocation, allowing servers to handle 100,000+ concurrent requests on modest hardware compared to Java's thread pools that max out at thousands, revolutionizing microservice scalability while maintaining imperative code readability that reactive frameworks sacrifice.

## Example 29: Async and Await for Returning Results

`async` creates a coroutine that returns a `Deferred<T>` result. `await()` suspends until the result is ready. Use `async` for parallel computations that return values.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
// => kotlinx.coroutines provides async/await for concurrent computations with return values
// => Requires 'org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core' dependency

suspend fun fetchUserData(userId: Int): String {
    // => Parameter: userId for identifying which user data to fetch
    // => Use case: simulates HTTP GET request to user service endpoint
    // => Thread behavior: suspends WITHOUT blocking thread during delay

    delay(1000)
    // => Thread: RELEASED back to pool during delay (not blocked)
    // => Simulates: network latency for fetching user data from remote API
    // => Cooperative: coroutine yields execution during delay

    return "User data for $userId"
    // => Return value: constructed string containing user ID
    // => Output: "User data for 1" for userId=1, "User data for 2" for userId=2
}

suspend fun fetchUserPosts(userId: Int): List<String> {
    // => Parameter: userId to fetch posts for specific user
    // => Use case: simulates fetching user's blog posts from API endpoint
    // => Delay: 800ms (faster than user data fetch - realistic scenario)

    delay(800)
    // => Non-blocking: thread can execute other coroutines during this delay

    return listOf("Post 1", "Post 2")
}

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // => Use case: bridge between blocking main() and suspending coroutine world
    // => Scope: provides CoroutineScope receiver for launching child coroutines

    // Sequential execution (slow)
    val startSeq = System.currentTimeMillis()
    // => Use: baseline for measuring sequential execution time

    val userData = fetchUserData(1)

    val userPosts = fetchUserPosts(1)
    // => Thread: released during delay, but already waited 1000ms above
    // => Total time so far: 1000ms + 800ms = 1800ms

    val timeSeq = System.currentTimeMillis() - startSeq
    // => Calculates elapsed time: current time minus start time
    // => Value: ~1800ms (1000ms for userData + 800ms for userPosts)
    // => Variation: may be 1795-1805ms due to scheduling overhead

    println("Sequential: $timeSeq ms")
    // => Output: Sequential: 1800 ms (approximately, ±5ms variance)

    // Concurrent execution with async (fast)
    val startAsync = System.currentTimeMillis()
    // => Captures baseline time for async execution measurement
    // => Reset: new baseline independent of sequential execution
    // => Use: compare concurrent vs sequential performance

    val userDataDeferred = async { fetchUserData(2) }
    // => State: Deferred is ACTIVE (computation in progress)
    // => Timestamp: T=0ms (started immediately)
    // => Job: Deferred extends Job (can cancel, check status, join)
    // => Dispatcher: inherits parent's dispatcher (Dispatchers.Default from runBlocking)

    val userPostsDeferred = async { fetchUserPosts(2) }
    // => Execution: runs IN PARALLEL with fetchUserData (key advantage)
    // => Thread: may execute on SAME or DIFFERENT thread as userDataDeferred (thread pool)
    // => State: both Deferreds now ACTIVE simultaneously
    // => Return: instant return, both coroutines running concurrently

    val data = userDataDeferred.await()
    // => Execution: suspends current coroutine until userDataDeferred completes
    // => Timing: waits ~1000ms (fetchUserData duration)
    // => State machine: Deferred transitions ACTIVE -> COMPLETED, result available
    // => Return: extracts successful result from Deferred (or throws exception if failed)
    // => Timestamp: T=1000ms (waited for fetchUserData to complete)
    // => Concurrent benefit: userPostsDeferred was running during this wait

    val posts = userPostsDeferred.await()
    // => Execution: userPostsDeferred already COMPLETED (800ms < 1000ms)
    // => Thread: NO suspension needed (result already available)
    // => Timestamp: T=1000ms (no additional time - result ready)
    // => Total async time: max(1000ms, 800ms) = 1000ms (concurrent execution)

    val timeAsync = System.currentTimeMillis() - startAsync
    // => Calculates elapsed time for async execution
    // => Performance: 800ms faster than sequential (44% time reduction)

    println("Async: $timeAsync ms")
    // => Output: Async: 1000 ms (approximately, ±5ms variance)
    // => Speedup: 1800ms -> 1000ms (1.8x faster)

    println("Data: $data")
    // => Output: Data: User data for 2

    println("Posts: $posts")
    // => Output: Posts: [Post 1, Post 2]
}
// => Sequential execution: 1800ms (1000ms + 800ms additive delays)
// => Async execution: 1000ms (max(1000ms, 800ms) concurrent delays)
// => Deferred advantage: type-safe futures with structured concurrency and exception handling
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `async` for concurrent computations that return results; `await()` retrieves the result while suspending the coroutine.

**Why It Matters**: Parallel API calls are ubiquitous in microservices (fetching user data + posts + permissions simultaneously), yet Java's CompletableFuture composition is verbose and error-prone with complex exception handling. Kotlin's async/await enables natural parallel execution with sequential-looking code, reducing latency from additive (1000ms + 800ms = 1800ms) to maximum (max(1000ms, 800ms) = 1000ms), cutting response times 40-60% in typical aggregation endpoints while maintaining readable code that junior developers can understand.

## Example 30: Structured Concurrency with CoroutineScope

Structured concurrency ensures child coroutines are cancelled when the parent scope is cancelled, preventing coroutine leaks. `coroutineScope` creates a child scope that waits for all children to complete.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
// => Import coroutine scope builders (coroutineScope, runBlocking, withTimeout)
// => withTimeout: enforces time limits on coroutine execution

suspend fun processData(): String = coroutineScope {
    // => Waits for children: BLOCKS (suspends) until ALL child coroutines complete
    // => Exception handling: if ANY child throws exception, ALL children cancelled and exception rethrown
    // => Cancellation propagation: if parent cancels, this scope and children auto-cancel
    // => Thread: does NOT create new threads (inherits parent's dispatcher)
    // => Use case: group related concurrent operations with automatic cleanup

    val result1 = async {
        // => Parent: this coroutine is child of coroutineScope (structured)
        // => Execution: starts immediately (concurrent with result2 async)
        // => State: ACTIVE (computation running in background)

        delay(1000)
        // => Thread: released during delay (non-blocking)

        "Data 1"
        // => Access: retrieved via result1.await()
    }

    val result2 = async {
        // => State: both result1 and result2 ACTIVE simultaneously
        // => Lifecycle: coroutineScope waits for BOTH to complete

        delay(500)
        // => Thread: released during delay
        // => Simulates: faster operation than result1
        // => Completion: finishes BEFORE result1 (500ms < 1000ms)

        "Data 2"
        // => Access: retrieved via result2.await()
        // => State: Deferred transitions to COMPLETED while result1 still running
    }

    "${result1.await()} + ${result2.await()}"
    // => String template: combines both async results
    // => result1.await(): suspends until result1 completes (~1000ms wait)
    // => Concurrent execution: total time = max(1000ms, 500ms) = 1000ms
}
// => Total execution time: 1000ms (concurrent, not 1500ms sequential)
// => Exception handling: if result1 or result2 throws exception, other is cancelled and exception propagates

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // => Thread: main thread BLOCKED (waits for completion)
    // => Use case: bridge between blocking main() and suspending coroutine world

    try {
        // => Exception handling: catches timeout and other exceptions
        // => Scope: error propagation from withTimeout and processData

        val result = withTimeout(2000) {
            // => Timeout behavior: throws TimeoutCancellationException if exceeds 2000ms
            // => Cancellation: if timeout occurs, processData and children auto-cancel
            // => Structured concurrency: timeout cancels entire scope tree below

            processData()
            // => Execution: waits for both result1 (1000ms) and result2 (500ms) to complete
            // => Timeout check: 1000ms < 2000ms (completes successfully)
            // => Return: "Data 1 + Data 2"
        }
        // => Success: operation completed within timeout limit

        println("Result: $result")
        // => Output: Result: Data 1 + Data 2
        // => Execution path: normal completion (no timeout exception)

    } catch (e: TimeoutCancellationException) {
        // => Catches timeout exception: occurs if processData exceeds 2000ms

        println("Timeout!")
        // => Output: Timeout! (only if processData exceeds 2000ms)
    }

    // Demonstrate cancellation propagation
    val job = launch {
        // => Parent: child of runBlocking scope (structured concurrency)
        // => Execution: starts immediately, runs concurrently with main coroutine

        coroutineScope {
            // => Parent-child: this scope is child of launch coroutine above
            // => Waits: coroutineScope suspends until both child launches complete

            launch {
                // => Parent: child of coroutineScope (grandchild of job)

                repeat(5) { i ->

                    println("Child 1: $i")
                    // => Output: Child 1: 0, Child 1: 1, Child 1: 2, Child 1: 3 (then cancelled)

                    delay(300)
                    // => Thread: released during delay
                }
            }

            launch {
                // => Parent: child of coroutineScope (grandchild of job)

                repeat(5) { i ->
                    // => Cancellation: same automatic cancellation as Child 1

                    println("Child 2: $i")
                    // => Output: Child 2: 0, Child 2: 1, Child 2: 2 (then cancelled)

                    delay(400)
                    // => Thread: released during delay
                }
            }
        }
    }

    delay(1000)
    // => Thread: main thread released during delay

    job.cancel()
    // => Cancels job: stops parent launch coroutine
    // => Propagation: coroutineScope and both child launches auto-cancel (structured concurrency)
    // => State: Job transitions ACTIVE -> CANCELLING -> CANCELLED

    println("Job cancelled")
    // => Output: Job cancelled
    // => No leaks: structured concurrency guarantees no orphaned coroutines remain
}
// => Structured concurrency guarantees:
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `coroutineScope` for structured concurrency that automatically cancels children when parent is cancelled; use `withTimeout` to enforce time limits.

**Why It Matters**: Unstructured concurrency in Java (spawning threads without lifecycle management) causes resource leaks that crash production servers after hours of uptime as orphaned threads accumulate. Structured concurrency guarantees that child coroutines cannot outlive their parent scope, eliminating an entire class of memory leaks while providing automatic cleanup on cancellation, timeout, or exception—critical for request-scoped operations in web servers where abandoned background tasks must die when HTTP connections close.

## Example 31: Coroutine Context and Dispatchers

Dispatchers control which thread pool executes coroutines.

**Dispatcher Types**:

- **Dispatchers.Default**: CPU-intensive work. Pool size = CPU cores (e.g., 8 threads on 8-core CPU). Use for computation, parsing, sorting.
- **Dispatchers.IO**: I/O operations. Pool size = max(64, CPU cores × 2). Use for file I/O, database queries, network requests. Shares underlying threads with Default but different limits.
- **Dispatchers.Unconfined**: No thread affinity. Starts on caller thread, resumes wherever suspension completes. AVOID in production (unpredictable threading).
- **Custom dispatchers**: Create dedicated thread pools. Use `newSingleThreadContext()` for serial execution, actor model, thread-confined state. Must call `close()` to release resources.

**Thread Behavior**: Coroutines may resume on different threads after suspension (no thread affinity in Default/IO pools). Threads released during `delay()` for other coroutines to use.

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // Default dispatcher (CPU-intensive work)
    launch(Dispatchers.Default) {
        // => Uses Default thread pool (CPU cores threads)

        val threadName = Thread.currentThread().name
        // => e.g., "DefaultDispatcher-worker-1"

        println("Default: $threadName")
        // => Output: Default: DefaultDispatcher-worker-1

        repeat(3) { i ->
            println("CPU work $i")
            // => Output: CPU work 0, CPU work 1, CPU work 2
            delay(100)
            // => Thread released during delay, may resume on different thread
        }
    }

    // IO dispatcher (I/O operations, larger pool)
    launch(Dispatchers.IO) {
        // => Uses IO thread pool (64+ threads)

        val threadName = Thread.currentThread().name
        println("IO: $threadName")
        // => Output: IO: DefaultDispatcher-worker-2

        delay(500)
        // => Simulates I/O operation (file read, HTTP request)

        println("IO complete")
        // => Output: IO complete
    }

    // Unconfined dispatcher (unpredictable threading)
    launch(Dispatchers.Unconfined) {
        println("Unconfined initial: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
        // => Output: Unconfined initial: main (starts on caller thread)

        delay(100)
        // => Suspends, releases main thread

        println("Unconfined resumed: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
        // => Output: Unconfined resumed: kotlinx.coroutines.DefaultExecutor
        // => Thread switch: main -> DefaultExecutor (unpredictable)
    }

    // Custom dispatcher (single dedicated thread)
    val customDispatcher = newSingleThreadContext("CustomThread")
    // => Creates dedicated thread named "CustomThread"
    // => Must call close() when done

    launch(customDispatcher) {
        println("Custom: ${Thread.currentThread().name}")
        // => Output: Custom: CustomThread
    }

    customDispatcher.close()
    // => Closes dispatcher, terminates CustomThread

    delay(1000)
    // => Waits for all child coroutines to complete
}
```

**Dispatcher Comparison**:

- **Default**: CPU cores threads, CPU-bound work (computation, parsing)
- **IO**: 64+ threads, I/O-bound work (file I/O, network, database)
- **Unconfined**: No dedicated threads, testing only (unpredictable in production)
- **Custom**: Dedicated threads, sequential execution, must manage lifecycle

**Use Cases**:

- Default: Sorting large arrays, parsing JSON, cryptographic operations
- IO: File reads/writes, HTTP requests, database queries
- Custom: Actor model, thread-confined mutable state, sequential processing

````

**Key Takeaway**: Choose `Dispatchers.Default` for CPU work, `Dispatchers.IO` for blocking I/O, and create custom dispatchers for specific threading needs.

**Why It Matters**: Thread pool selection in Java requires manual ExecutorService configuration with magic numbers that developers tune incorrectly, causing either thread starvation (too few threads) or context switching overhead (too many threads). Kotlin's dispatchers provide semantic thread pool choices (Default for CPU-bound, IO for blocking operations) with proven sizing algorithms, while coroutines on IO dispatcher can spawn thousands of concurrent tasks without the one-thread-per-task limitation that forces Java developers into callback hell or reactive libraries.

## Example 32: Channels for Communication Between Coroutines

Channels enable safe communication between coroutines. `send()` suspends when buffer is full, `receive()` suspends when channel is empty. Channels are hot streams.

```mermaid
%% Channel communication pattern showing producer and consumer
sequenceDiagram
    participant Producer as Producer Coroutine
    participant Channel as Channel<Int>
    participant Consumer as Consumer Coroutine

    Producer->>Channel: send(1)
    Note over Channel: Buffer stores 1
    Producer->>Channel: send(2)
    Note over Channel: Buffer stores 2

    Consumer->>Channel: receive()
    Channel-->>Consumer: Returns 1
    Note over Channel: Buffer now has 2

    Producer->>Channel: send(3)
    Note over Channel: Buffer stores 3

    Consumer->>Channel: receive()
    Channel-->>Consumer: Returns 2
    Consumer->>Channel: receive()
    Channel-->>Consumer: Returns 3

    Producer->>Channel: close()
    Note over Channel: No more sends allowed

fun main() = runBlocking {
    // => Use case: bridge between blocking main() and suspending coroutine world

    // Unbuffered channel (rendezvous)
    val unbufferedChannel = Channel<Int>()

        // => Dispatcher: inherits runBlocking's dispatcher (main thread) unless specified

        // => Cancellation: if parent scope cancels, this producer auto-cancels (structured concurrency)

        repeat(3) { i ->

            println("Sending $i")
            // => Output: Sending 0, Sending 1, Sending 2
            // => Thread: runs on main thread (runBlocking's dispatcher)
            // => Order: interleaved with "Received" messages due to rendezvous handshake

            unbufferedChannel.send(i)
            // => Rendezvous behavior: send and receive must meet simultaneously (handshake)
            // => Thread release: producer thread released back to pool during suspension (non-blocking)
            // => Resume: producer resumes AFTER consumer receives value and acknowledges
            // => Order guarantee: send(0) completes BEFORE send(1) starts (sequential sending)
            // => Exception: if channel closed, throws ClosedSendChannelException
            // => Return: Unit (no return value, side-effect operation)

            println("Sent $i")
            // => Output: Sent 0, Sent 1, Sent 2
            // => Timing: proves rendezvous - this line doesn't execute until receive() acknowledges
            // => Order: "Sent 0" appears AFTER "Received 0" because consumer delay is minimal
        }

        unbufferedChannel.close()
        // => Behavior: existing buffered values still receivable (none here, unbuffered)
        // => State: channel transitions from OPEN to CLOSED state
        // => Best practice: ALWAYS close channels when done sending (signals completion to receivers)
    }

            // => Producer impact: producer WAITS during this delay (rendezvous forces sync)
        }
    }

    delay(1000)
    // => delay(1000): ensures producer/consumer have time to complete
    // => Thread: main thread suspended during delay, but children run concurrently

    // Buffered channel (capacity 2)
    val bufferedChannel = Channel<Int>(2)
    // => Buffer: can store up to 2 values without receiver being ready
    // => Receive behavior: receive() suspends if buffer empty (no values available)

    launch {
        // => launch: producer coroutine for buffered channel demonstration
        // => Objective: show send() doesn't block until buffer full (capacity 2)

        bufferedChannel.send(1)
        // => send(1): sends value 1 to buffered channel
        // => Thread: continues immediately without yielding to consumer

        println("Sent 1 (buffered)")
        // => Output: Sent 1 (buffered)
        // => Proof: "Sent 1" appears BEFORE "Receiving from buffer" (producer ahead of consumer)

        bufferedChannel.send(2)
        // => send(2): sends value 2 to buffered channel
        // => Suspension: does NOT suspend because buffer still has space (1/2 -> 2/2 full)

        println("Sent 2 (buffered)")
        // => Output: Sent 2 (buffered)

        bufferedChannel.send(3)
        // => send(3): attempts to send value 3 to full buffer
        // => Backpressure: full buffer signals consumer to catch up (natural flow control)

        println("Sent 3 (buffered)")
        // => Output: Sent 3 (buffered)

        bufferedChannel.close()
        // => close(): marks channel closed for sending
    }

    delay(500)
    // => delay(500): waits 500ms to let producer fill buffer and attempt send(3)

    println("Receiving from buffer")
    // => Output: Receiving from buffer
    // => Buffer state: [1, 2] full, producer suspended on send(3)

    println(bufferedChannel.receive())
    // => Suspension: does NOT suspend because buffer has values (2/2 full)
    // => Output: 1
    // => Producer resumes: send(3) completes, buffer becomes [2, 3] full again

    println(bufferedChannel.receive())
    // => Suspension: does NOT suspend (buffer has value 2)
    // => Return: value 2
    // => Output: 2
    // => Capacity: 1/2 slots used

    println(bufferedChannel.receive())
    // => receive(): retrieves third value from buffer
    // => Suspension: does NOT suspend (buffer has value 3)
    // => Return: value 3
    // => Output: 3
    // => Channel state: CLOSED and EMPTY (no more values, no more sends)
}
// => Thread pool: coroutine threads returned to pool, main thread unblocked
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use unbuffered channels for rendezvous (synchronization), buffered channels for decoupling producer/consumer rates; always close channels when done sending.

**Why It Matters**: Channels provide Go-style CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes) for Kotlin coroutines, enabling producer-consumer patterns that Java's BlockingQueue handles poorly due to thread blocking. Unlike Java where send/receive blocks threads, Kotlin channels suspend coroutines, allowing efficient backpressure handling in streaming data pipelines processing WebSocket messages, log aggregation, or real-time analytics without dedicating threads to waiting, improving throughput 10-100x in I/O-bound systems.

## Example 33: Flow for Cold Asynchronous Streams

Flow is a cold asynchronous stream that emits values on demand. Unlike channels (hot), flows don't produce values until collected. Flows support backpressure and transformation operators.

        // => collect: SECOND collection of same flow
        // => Fresh execution: new delay sequence, new emissions
        // => No operators: this collect has no map/filter (receives raw values 1-5)

        println("Second collect: $value")
        // => Proof of cold: flow executed TWICE (not cached or shared)
    }
}
// => Comparison: Channels are HOT (produce values regardless of consumers)
// => Use case: Flow for on-demand data (cold), Channel for event broadcasting (hot)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Flows are cold streams that execute lazily on collection; use transformation operators like `map`, `filter` before terminal operators like `collect`.

**Why It Matters**: Java Streams are eager and synchronous, forcing developers to either collect entire datasets into memory or use complex reactive libraries (RxJava, Project Reactor) with steep learning curves. Kotlin Flow provides lazy asynchronous streams that work naturally with coroutines, enabling streaming data processing that starts computation only when needed (cold semantics) while supporting cancellation and exception propagation, perfect for paginated API responses and database cursors where loading all data upfront wastes memory.

        // => - T=600ms: collector finishes 0, receives latest value 4 (1,2,3 dropped)

        // => Use case simulation: slow rendering that can't keep up with rapid data updates
    }
    // => Conflate total: only 2 values collected from 5 emitted (60% data loss)
    // => Trade-off: lower latency (always process latest) vs completeness (lose intermediate)
    // => Use case: stock ticker UI (show latest price, skip intermediate updates)
}
// => Summary:
// => - transform: one-to-many emissions (1 input -> multiple outputs)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `transform` for one-to-many emissions, `buffer` to improve throughput with slow consumers, `conflate` to drop intermediate values when only latest matters.

**Why It Matters**: Flow operators solve backpressure and performance tuning problems that require manual coding in Java streams or complex reactive operators in RxJava. The buffer operator decouples fast producers from slow consumers without blocking threads, while conflate enables real-time UIs to skip stale updates (showing latest stock price rather than replaying every tick), patterns essential for responsive applications processing high-frequency data like sensor streams or market feeds without overwhelming rendering threads.

## Example 35: StateFlow and SharedFlow for Hot Streams

`StateFlow` holds a single state value with initial state; subscribers get current state immediately. `SharedFlow` broadcasts events to all collectors without state retention.

**StateFlow vs SharedFlow:**

- **StateFlow**: Hot stream with state retention. Requires initial value. New collectors get current state immediately. Conflation: rapid updates merged (latest wins). Use case: observable state (UI state, ViewModel state)
- **SharedFlow**: Hot stream for event broadcasting. No state retention (unless replay > 0). No initial value. New collectors miss past events (replay=0 default). Use case: one-time events (button clicks, errors, navigation)
- **Hot vs Cold**: Hot streams (StateFlow/SharedFlow) emit regardless of collectors with single shared stream. Cold streams create new instance per collector

**StateFlow Behavior:**

```mermaid
%% StateFlow holds state with initial value

    style SHFC1 fill:#CC78BC,color:#000
    style SHFC2 fill:#CC78BC,color:#000
```

**Implementation Pattern:**

- **Encapsulation**: Private mutable flows (`MutableStateFlow`, `MutableSharedFlow`), public read-only interfaces (`StateFlow`, `SharedFlow`)
- **MutableSharedFlow defaults**: replay=0, extraBufferCapacity=0, onBufferOverflow=SUSPEND
- **Thread-safety**: Both StateFlow.value and SharedFlow.emit() are thread-safe
- **Lifecycle**: Flows exist as long as containing instance exists

```kotlin
import kotlinx.coroutines.*
// => Provides runBlocking, launch, delay

import kotlinx.coroutines.flow.*
// => Provides StateFlow, SharedFlow, MutableStateFlow, MutableSharedFlow

class Counter {
    private val _stateFlow = MutableStateFlow(0)
    // => Initial value: 0 (required for StateFlow)
    val stateFlow: StateFlow<Int> = _stateFlow
    // => Public read-only interface

    private val _sharedFlow = MutableSharedFlow<String>()
    // => Default: replay=0 (no past events for new collectors)
    val sharedFlow: SharedFlow<String> = _sharedFlow
    // => Public read-only interface

    fun increment() {
        _stateFlow.value++
        // => Notifies ALL active collectors
        // => Alternative: StateFlow.update { it + 1 } (safer for concurrent updates)

**Comparison with Android LiveData:**

- **LiveData**: Lifecycle-aware, nullable, not coroutine-native, setValue() main thread only
- **StateFlow**: Not lifecycle-aware, non-null, coroutine-native, value assignment thread-safe

**Performance:**

- **StateFlow collectors**: O(N) notification where N = number of collectors
- **Conflation**: Prevents UI overload (only latest value matters)
- **Thread-safety**: Built-in (no external synchronization needed)

**Key Takeaway**: Use `StateFlow` for observable state with initial value and conflation; use `SharedFlow` for event broadcasting without state.

**Why It Matters**: Android's LiveData and RxJava's BehaviorSubject serve similar purposes but lack coroutine integration and type safety. StateFlow provides the observable state pattern critical for MVVM architectures with built-in coroutine support, conflation (latest value wins) preventing UI overload, and compile-time null safety unlike LiveData's runtime nullability. SharedFlow replaces EventBus libraries with type-safe event broadcasting, eliminating reflection-based coupling and enabling multi-subscriber patterns for cross-component communication in modular architectures.

## Example 36: Collection Operations - Map, Filter, Reduce

Kotlin provides rich functional operations on collections. These operations don't modify original collections but return new ones.

**Operation Categories**:

- **map**: One-to-one transformation (input size = output size). Can change element type.
- **filter**: Selection by predicate (input size ≥ output size). Keeps only matching elements.
- **reduce**: Many-to-one aggregation. Uses first element as initial accumulator. Throws on empty collection.
- **fold**: Like reduce but with explicit initial value. Safe on empty collections.
- **flatMap**: One-to-many transformation with flattening. Maps nested structures to flat list.

**Immutability**: All operations return new collections. Original collection remains unchanged (thread-safe).

**Performance**: O(N) time per operation. Use `asSequence()` for lazy evaluation on large collections.

**reduce vs fold**: `reduce` requires non-empty collection and uses first element as accumulator. `fold` accepts explicit initial value and works on empty collections (safer for production code).

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

    // map: transform each element
    val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }
    // => [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

    val strings = numbers.map { "N$it" }
    // => ["N1", "N2", "N3", "N4", "N5", "N6"] (Int -> String)

    println("Doubled: $doubled")
    // => Output: Doubled: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12]

    println("Strings: $strings")
    // => Output: Strings: [N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6]

    // filter: keep elements matching predicate
    val evens = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    // => Keeps 2, 4, 6 (even numbers)
    // => [2, 4, 6]

    val greaterThan3 = numbers.filter { it > 3 }
    // => Keeps 4, 5, 6
    // => [4, 5, 6]

    println("Evens: $evens")
    // => Output: Evens: [2, 4, 6]

    println("Greater than 3: $greaterThan3")
    // => Output: Greater than 3: [4, 5, 6]

    // reduce: accumulate values (requires non-empty collection)
    val sum = numbers.reduce { acc, value -> acc + value }
    // => acc starts at 1 (first element)
    // => 1+2=3, 3+3=6, 6+4=10, 10+5=15, 15+6=21
    // => 21

    val product = numbers.reduce { acc, value -> acc * value }
    // => 1*2=2, 2*3=6, 6*4=24, 24*5=120, 120*6=720
    // => 720

    println("Sum: $sum")
    // => Output: Sum: 21

    println("Product: $product")
    // => Output: Product: 720

    // fold: reduce with initial value (works on empty collections)
    val sumWithInitial = numbers.fold(100) { acc, value -> acc + value }
    // => acc starts at 100 (explicit initial value)
    // => 100+1=101, 101+2=103, ..., 115+6=121
    // => 121

    val emptyList = emptyList<Int>()
    // => []

    val safeSum = emptyList.fold(0) { acc, value -> acc + value }
    // => Safe on empty (returns initial value 0)
    // => 0

    println("Sum with initial: $sumWithInitial")
    // => Output: Sum with initial: 121

    println("Safe sum: $safeSum")
    // => Output: Safe sum: 0

    // flatMap: map and flatten
    val nestedLists = listOf(listOf(1, 2), listOf(3, 4), listOf(5))
    // => [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]

    val flattened = nestedLists.flatMap { it }
    // => Flattens nested lists
    // => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    val doubledFlat = nestedLists.flatMap { list -> list.map { it * 2 } }
    // => Maps each inner list (doubles elements), then flattens
    // => [[2, 4], [6, 8], [10]] -> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

    println("Flattened: $flattened")
    // => Output: Flattened: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    println("Doubled flat: $doubledFlat")
    // => Output: Doubled flat: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}
```

**Common Use Cases**:

- **map**: Transform DTOs, convert types, format data
- **filter**: Select valid records, remove nulls, apply business rules
- **reduce**: Calculate totals, find max/min, combine values
- **fold**: Safe aggregation, build complex objects from elements
- **flatMap**: Process nested JSON, flatten hierarchical structures

**Comparison with Java Streams**: Kotlin operations work directly on collections (no `.stream().collect()` ceremony). Kotlin is eager by default while Java Streams are lazy. Better type inference reduces verbosity.

**Key Takeaway**: Collection operations create new collections without mutating originals; use `map` for transformation, `filter` for selection, `reduce`/`fold` for aggregation, `flatMap` for nested structures.

**Why It Matters**: Java 8 Streams introduced functional collection operations late, but Kotlin's collection methods are simpler (no .stream().collect() ceremony) and work on all collections by default. The immutable-by-default approach prevents accidental mutations during transformations that corrupt shared data structures in multi-threaded services, while fold's ability to handle empty collections with default values prevents the NoSuchElementException crashes that plague Java's Stream.reduce() when processing empty result sets from databases or API responses.

## Example 37: Collection Operations - GroupBy, Partition, Associate

Advanced collection operations enable complex data transformations and grouping.

**Operation Categories**:

- **groupBy**: Groups elements by key into `Map<K, List<V>>`. Elements with same key grouped in list.
- **partition**: Binary split into `Pair<List<T>, List<T>>` based on predicate. Returns (trueList, falseList).
- **associate**: Creates `Map<K, V>` from collection using key-value pairs. Duplicate keys: last wins (potential data loss).
- **associateBy**: Uses element as value, selector provides key. Creates lookup map.
- **associateWith**: Uses element as key, lambda provides value. Precompute operations.

**Comparison**:

- **groupBy vs associate**: groupBy allows multiple values per key (Map<K, List<V>>). associate allows one value per key (Map<K, V>).
- **partition vs groupBy**: partition creates 2 fixed groups. groupBy creates dynamic N groups.

**Performance**: O(N) time, O(N) space. Thread-safe (immutable results).

```kotlin
data class Person(val name: String, val age: Int, val city: String)
// => Auto-generated: equals(), hashCode(), toString(), copy()

fun main() {
    val people = listOf(
        Person("Alice", 30, "NYC"),
        Person("Bob", 25, "LA"),
        Person("Charlie", 30, "NYC"),
        Person("Diana", 25, "LA"),
        Person("Eve", 35, "NYC")
    )
    // => 5 people: ages 25/30/35, cities NYC/LA

    // groupBy: group elements by key
    val byAge = people.groupBy { it.age }
    // => Groups by age: {25=[Bob, Diana], 30=[Alice, Charlie], 35=[Eve]}

    println("Grouped by age:")
    // => Output: Grouped by age:

    byAge.forEach { (age, persons) ->
        // => Destructures Map.Entry<Int, List<Person>>
        println("  Age $age: ${persons.map { it.name }}")
        // => Output: Age 25: [Bob, Diana]
        // =>         Age 30: [Alice, Charlie]
        // =>         Age 35: [Eve]
    }

    val byCity = people.groupBy { it.city }
    // => Groups by city: {NYC=[Alice, Charlie, Eve], LA=[Bob, Diana]}

    println("Grouped by city:")
    byCity.forEach { (city, persons) ->
        println("  $city: ${persons.map { it.name }}")
        // => Output: NYC: [Alice, Charlie, Eve]
        // =>         LA: [Bob, Diana]
    }

    // partition: split into two lists based on predicate
    val (under30, over30) = people.partition { it.age < 30 }
    // => Splits at age<30: ([Bob, Diana], [Alice, Charlie, Eve])
    // => Destructuring extracts both lists

    println("\nUnder 30: ${under30.map { it.name }}")
    // => Output: Under 30: [Bob, Diana]

    println("30 and over: ${over30.map { it.name }}")
    // => Output: 30 and over: [Alice, Charlie, Eve]

    // associate: create map from collection
    val nameToAge = people.associate { it.name to it.age }
    // => Creates key-value pairs: {Alice=30, Bob=25, Charlie=30, Diana=25, Eve=35}

    println("\nName to age: $nameToAge")
    // => Output: Name to age: {Alice=30, Bob=25, Charlie=30, Diana=25, Eve=35}

    // associateBy: use key selector
    val peopleByName = people.associateBy { it.name }
    // => Name as key, Person as value: {Alice=Person(...), Bob=Person(...), ...}

    println("Person by name: ${peopleByName["Alice"]}")
    // => Output: Person by name: Person(name=Alice, age=30, city=NYC)

    // associateWith: use value generator
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)
    val squares = numbers.associateWith { it * it }
    // => Number as key, square as value: {1=1, 2=4, 3=9, 4=16}

    println("Squares: $squares")
    // => Output: Squares: {1=1, 2=4, 3=9, 4=16}
}
```

**Associate Family Comparison**:

- **associate**: Full control (specify both key and value). `people.associate { it.id to it.email }`
- **associateBy**: Element as value, selector as key. `products.associateBy { it.id }`
- **associateWith**: Element as key, lambda as value. `configKeys.associateWith { getDefaultValue(it) }`

**Common Use Cases**:

- **groupBy**: Categorize data (orders by customer, users by role)
- **partition**: Binary classification (paid/unpaid, valid/invalid)
- **associate**: Create lookups (ID → entity, code → description)
- **associateBy**: Index collections (user list → map by userId)
- **associateWith**: Precompute values (config key → default value)

**Comparison with Java**: Java's `Collectors.groupingBy()` requires verbose nested collectors. Kotlin returns simple `Map<K, List<V>>` without ceremony.

**Error Handling**:

- **groupBy**: Never fails (empty collection → empty map)
- **partition**: Never fails (empty collection → pair of empty lists)
- **associate/associateBy**: Duplicate keys → last value overwrites (silent data loss, be careful)
- **associateWith**: Keys from collection (duplicates impossible if collection unique)

**Key Takeaway**: Use `groupBy` for creating maps of grouped elements, `partition` for binary splits, `associate` family for transforming collections into maps.

**Why It Matters**: Data aggregation and grouping operations are common in business logic (grouping orders by customer, partitioning users by subscription tier), yet Java's Collectors.groupingBy() syntax is notoriously complex with nested collectors. Kotlin's groupBy returns a simple Map<K, List<V>> without ceremony, while partition's destructuring assignment (val (paid, free) = users.partition { it.isPaid }) makes conditional splits self-documenting, reducing cognitive load in analytics code that processes thousands of records to generate business insights.

## Example 38: Sequences for Lazy Evaluation

Sequences compute elements lazily, avoiding intermediate collection creation. Use sequences for multi-step transformations on large collections.

**Eager vs Lazy Evaluation:**

- **Eager (List)**: Processes ALL elements immediately. Each operation (map, filter) creates intermediate collections. For 1M elements with 3 operations: creates 3 temporary million-element lists (~8MB garbage). Total operations: ~2 million
- **Lazy (Sequence)**: Processes elements on-demand, one at a time. No intermediate collections. Each element flows through entire pipeline before next element starts. Total operations: only what's needed (~1,015 for 5 results from 1M elements)
- **Performance**: Sequences are 2000x fewer operations, 200x faster execution, 75% less memory
- **Use cases**: Eager for small collections or when all elements needed. Lazy for large data, early termination, infinite sequences

**Execution Order Comparison:**

- **Eager**: All map operations first, then all filter operations (batched by operation type)
- **Lazy**: Element-by-element through entire pipeline (interleaved operations)

```kotlin
fun main() {
    // Eager evaluation with list (creates intermediate lists)
    val listResult = (1..1_000_000)
        // => IntRange 1 to 1,000,000

        .map { it * 2 }
        // => EAGER: processes ALL 1M elements immediately
        // => Creates [2, 4, 6, ..., 2_000_000] (1M element list)

        .filter { it > 1000 }
        // => Processes entire mapped list
        // => No short-circuiting (computes 999,995 unnecessary elements)

        .take(5)
        // => Result: [1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, 1010]

    // => Output: Sequence result: [1002, 1004, 1006, 1008, 1010]

    println("\nFibonacci: $fibonacci")
    // => Output: Fibonacci: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Sequences optimize multi-step transformations by evaluating lazily element-by-element; use `asSequence()` for large collections or infinite streams.

**Why It Matters**: Java Streams create intermediate collections for each operation (map, filter, etc.) causing memory pressure when processing millions of records, while Kotlin Sequences compute elements on-demand without materialization. Processing a million-element list with three transformations in Java creates three temporary million-element collections, while Sequences process one element through all transformations before moving to the next, reducing memory usage by 75% and enabling infinite streams (Fibonacci, primes) that would exhaust heap space with eager evaluation.

## Example 39: Property Delegation - Lazy and Observable

Delegate property implementations to reusable delegate objects. `lazy` computes value on first access, `observable` triggers callbacks on changes.

**Delegation Types:**

- **lazy**: Executes initializer once on first access, caches result. Thread-safe by default (SYNCHRONIZED mode). Use for expensive initialization that may never be needed (database connections, configuration parsing)
- **observable**: Triggers callback AFTER property change. Use for logging, UI updates, audit trail (post-change notifications)
- **vetoable**: Validates BEFORE property change. Returns boolean to approve/reject. NOT thread-safe. Use for input validation, business rule enforcement

**Thread Safety Modes (lazy):**

- **SYNCHRONIZED** (default): Thread-safe singleton initialization
- **PUBLICATION**: Allows multiple initializations, uses first completion
- **NONE**: No thread safety (single-threaded only)

**Delegation Benefits:**

- **Reusability**: Standard delegates work with any property type
- **Separation**: Cross-cutting concerns separated from business logic
- **Declarative**: Intent clear from `by lazy`, `by observable`, `by vetoable` syntax
- **Zero boilerplate**: No manual getter/setter implementation

```kotlin
import kotlin.properties.Delegates
// => Provides observable(), vetoable(), notNull()

class User {
    // Lazy initialization (computed once on first access)
    val expensiveData: String by lazy {
        // => by lazy: delegates getValue to Lazy<String>
        // => Default: SYNCHRONIZED (thread-safe)

        println("Computing expensive data...")
        // => Output on FIRST access only

        Thread.sleep(1000)

        "Computed data"
        // => Cached until object garbage collected
    }

    // Observable property (callback on change)
    var name: String by Delegates.observable("Initial") { property, oldValue, newValue ->
        println("${property.name} changed: $oldValue -> $newValue")

    // Lazy property demonstration
    println("Before accessing expensiveData")
    // => Lazy state: initializer NOT executed yet

    println(user.expensiveData)
    // => First access: acquires lock, executes initializer, caches result, releases lock
    // => Output: Computing expensive data...
    //           Computed data
    // => Timing: ~1000ms

    println(user.expensiveData)
    // => Second access: returns cached value immediately

    // => Output: Age: 25

    user.age = -5
    // => Validator executes: valid = (-5 >= 0) = false
    // => Change VETOED: age remains 25
    // => Output: Rejected age: -5

    println("Age after veto: ${user.age}")
    // => Output: Age after veto: 25
}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Use `lazy` for expensive computations that should execute once, `observable` for change notifications, `vetoable` for validated property changes.

**Why It Matters**: Property initialization in Java requires manual lazy loading with double-checked locking patterns that developers implement incorrectly, causing thread safety bugs or unnecessary initialization overhead. Kotlin's lazy delegate provides guaranteed thread-safe singleton semantics with zero boilerplate, perfect for expensive resources (database connections, configuration parsing) that may never be accessed in some code paths. Observable properties enable reactive programming patterns like databinding and validation without observer boilerplate, critical for MVVM architectures where property changes must propagate to UI.

## Example 40: Custom Property Delegates

Create custom delegates by implementing `getValue` and `setValue` operators. Delegates encapsulate property access logic.

**Delegation Protocol:**

- **operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<\*>): T** - Required for read access
- **operator fun setValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<\*>, newValue: T)** - Required for write access
- **Contract**: ReadWriteProperty interface (both getValue + setValue)
- **Thread safety**: NOT thread-safe by default (concurrent writes can race)

**Custom Delegate Use Cases:**

- **Cross-cutting concerns**: Logging, validation, persistence, caching
- **Value transformation**: Format conversion, normalization, encryption
- **Access control**: Permission checks, lazy loading, proxy patterns
- **Reusability**: Single delegate implementation for multiple properties

**Production Examples:**

- **SharedPreferences delegate** (Android): Auto-persist property changes
- **Validation delegate**: Enforce business rules on assignment
- **Audit delegate**: Log all property changes for compliance
- **Cache delegate**: Lazy load from database, cache in memory

    Delegate->>Delegate: setValue(newValue)
    Delegate->>Delegate: Validate/Transform
    Delegate->>Storage: Write to storage

```

```kotlin
import kotlin.reflect.KProperty

class LoggingDelegate<T>(private var value: T) {
    // => Generic type T: works for String, Int, any type

    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): T {
        // => operator fun: required for delegation protocol

        println("[GET] ${property.name} = $value")
        // => Logs property access (audit trail, monitoring)

        return value
    }

    operator fun setValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>, newValue: T) {
        println("[SET] ${property.name}: $value -> $newValue")
        // => Logs old -> new value transition

        value = newValue
    }
}

class UppercaseDelegate {
    // => Transforms String values: lowercase storage, uppercase presentation

    private var value: String = ""

    operator fun getValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>): String {
        return value.uppercase()
        // => Client always sees uppercase
    }

    operator fun setValue(thisRef: Any?, property: KProperty<*>, newValue: String) {
        value = newValue.lowercase()
        // => Stores normalized lowercase version
        // => Invariant: value always lowercase
    }
}

class Config {
    var theme: String by LoggingDelegate("light")
    // => Initial value: "light"

    var username: String by UppercaseDelegate()
    // => Initial value: "" (default)
}

fun main() {
    val config = Config()
    // => Delegate state: theme="light", username=""

    // LoggingDelegate demonstration
    println(config.theme)
    // => Invokes LoggingDelegate.getValue()
    // => Output: [GET] theme = light
    //           light

    config.theme = "dark"
    // => Invokes LoggingDelegate.setValue()
    // => Output: [SET] theme: light -> dark

    println(config.theme)
    // => Output: [GET] theme = dark
    //           dark

    // UppercaseDelegate demonstration
    config.username = "Alice"
    // => Stores "alice" (lowercase)

    println(config.username)
    // => Returns "ALICE" (uppercase transformation)
    // => Output: ALICE

    config.username = "BOB"
    // => Stores "bob" (lowercase)

    println(config.username)
    // => Returns "BOB" (uppercase transformation)
    // => Output: BOB
    // => Consistency: always uppercase output regardless of input case
}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Implement `getValue`/`setValue` operators to create custom property delegates that encapsulate access logic like logging, validation, or transformation.

**Why It Matters**: Custom property delegates enable cross-cutting concerns (logging, validation, persistence) to be extracted into reusable components rather than scattered across getters/setters throughout the codebase. This delegation pattern is impossible in Java without verbose proxy classes, yet Kotlin's operator overloading makes it seamless. Use cases include automatic preference storage (Android SharedPreferences), field validation with custom rules, and audit logging for security-sensitive properties, all without modifying business logic code.

## Example 41: Extension Functions and Properties

Add methods and properties to existing classes without modifying source code. Extensions are resolved statically based on declared type.

```kotlin
// Extension function on String
fun String.isPalindrome(): Boolean {
    // => No modification: String class source code unchanged (extension exists separately)

    val cleaned = this.lowercase().replace(" ", "")
    // => Operation: converts "Radar" -> "radar", then removes spaces: "A man" -> "aman"
    // => Immutability: original String (this) remains unchanged

    return cleaned == cleaned.reversed()
    // => Operation: "radar" -> "radar" (equals), "kotlin" -> "niltok" (not equals)
    // => Return: Boolean (true if palindrome, false otherwise)
    // => Algorithmic complexity: O(n) for reverse + O(n) for comparison = O(n)
}
// => Resolution: static dispatch (not virtual - no polymorphism via inheritance)
//    (Java equivalent: public static boolean isPalindrome(String receiver))

// Extension function with parameters
fun Int.times(action: (Int) -> Unit) {

    for (i in 1..this) {
        // => Receiver: 'this' is the Int value (e.g., 5.times {...} -> this = 5)

        action(i)
    }
}
// => Comparison: stdlib repeat(n) vs this.times - similar but provides index

// Extension property
val String.wordCount: Int
    // => Getter required: properties must define custom getter (no default getter)
    // => Restriction: no setter for val (read-only), var extensions need explicit setter

    get() = this.split("\\s+".toRegex()).filter { it.isNotEmpty() }.size
    // => split("\\s+".toRegex()): splits on whitespace (\\s+ = one or more whitespace chars)
    // => filter { it.isNotEmpty() }: removes empty strings from split result
    // => Return: Int (word count)
    // => Edge case: empty string "" -> [""] -> filter -> [] -> 0
    // => Edge case: "  " (only spaces) -> ["", "", ""] -> filter -> [] -> 0

// Extension on nullable receiver
fun String?.orDefault(default: String = "N/A"): String {
    // => Parameter: default is String with default value "N/A"
    // => Pattern: nullable receiver extension for null-safe operations

    return this ?: default
    // => Null check: if this != null, return this; else return default
    // => Type coercion: this (String?) becomes String when not null
}
// => Use case: configuration defaults, optional values, database null handling

// Extension on List
fun <T> List<T>.secondOrNull(): T? {

    return if (size >= 2) this[1] else null
    // => Safety: no exception thrown (null returned instead)
}
// => Reusability: works with List<Int>, List<String>, List<Any>, etc.

fun main() {
    // String extension
    println("radar".isPalindrome())
    // => Execution: cleaned = "radar", reversed = "radar" -> true
    // => Output: true

    println("kotlin".isPalindrome())
    // => Execution: cleaned = "kotlin", reversed = "niltok" -> false
    // => Output: false

    println("A man a plan a canal Panama".isPalindrome())
    // => Execution: cleaned = "amanaplanacanalpanama", reversed = same -> true
    // => Output: true

    // Int extension with lambda
    print("Countdown: ")

    5.times { i -> print("$i ") }
    // => String template: "$i " interpolates i into string with space
    // => Output: 1 2 3 4 5 (numbers with spaces, on same line)

    println()

    // String property extension
    val text = "Hello Kotlin World"
    // => Value: 3-word string for wordCount test

    println("Word count: ${text.wordCount}")
    // => Execution: split on whitespace -> ["Hello", "Kotlin", "World"] -> size = 3
    // => Output: Word count: 3

    // Nullable extension
    val str1: String? = null
    // => Type annotation: required when initializing with null (inference can't determine type)

    val str2: String? = "Hello"

    println(str1.orDefault())
    // => Safe: no NullPointerException (extension handles null receiver)
    // => Output: N/A

    println(str2.orDefault())
    // => Output: Hello

    println(str1.orDefault("Empty"))
    // => Output: Empty

    // List extension
    val numbers = listOf(10, 20, 30)
    // => Size: 3 elements (indices 0, 1, 2)
    // => Value: [10, 20, 30]

    println(numbers.secondOrNull())
    // => Output: 20

    println(emptyList<Int>().secondOrNull())
    // => Safety: no exception (null returned instead of IndexOutOfBoundsException)
    // => Output: null
}
// => Real-world usage: extensions add fluent APIs to library classes without modification
```

**Key Takeaway**: Extension functions add methods to existing types without inheritance; they're resolved statically and ideal for utility functions on library classes.

**Why It Matters**: Extension functions enable adding domain-specific methods to third-party classes (String, List, Int) without inheritance or wrapper types, making Kotlin codebases more readable (e.g., `"text".isPalindrome()` vs `PalindromeUtils.check("text")`). The static resolution prevents method signature conflicts when multiple libraries define extensions with the same name, while nullable receiver extensions (`String?.orDefault()`) eliminate null-check boilerplate that plagues Java codebases. Over 60% of Kotlin standard library functions are implemented as extensions, demonstrating the pattern's power for creating fluent, domain-specific APIs without framework lock-in.

## Example 42: Inline Functions and Reified Type Parameters

Inline functions eliminate lambda allocation overhead by inlining bytecode. Reified type parameters preserve generic type information at runtime.

```kotlin
// Regular higher-order function (creates lambda object)
fun <T> regularFilter(list: List<T>, predicate: (T) -> Boolean): List<T> {
    // => Parameter: list is List<T>, predicate is (T) -> Boolean
    // => Bytecode: predicate stored as object implementing Function interface

    val result = mutableListOf<T>()

    for (item in list) {
        // => item: current element of type T

        if (predicate(item)) result.add(item)
        // => Overhead: virtual dispatch + potential cache miss
        // => result.add(item): mutates result list (side effect)
    }

    return result
}

// Inline function (no lambda allocation)
inline fun <T> inlineFilter(list: List<T>, predicate: (T) -> Boolean): List<T> {

    val result = mutableListOf<T>()

    for (item in list) {

        if (predicate(item)) result.add(item)
        // => No overhead: same performance as hand-written code
    }

    return result
}

// Inline with reified type parameter (type available at runtime)
inline fun <reified T> filterIsInstance(list: List<Any>): List<T> {
    // => Use case: generic type filtering, casting, class-based operations

    val result = mutableListOf<T>()
    // => Mutable list: accumulates items of type T
    // => Type safety: List<T> ensures only T instances added

    for (item in list) {

        if (item is T) result.add(item)
        // => Performance: instanceof bytecode instruction (fast)
    }

    return result
}
// => Solves: Java's type erasure problem (can't check "is T" in Java)
// => Use case: generic filtering, JSON parsing, dependency injection

// Reified for generic casting
inline fun <reified T> safeCast(value: Any): T? {
    // => Use case: safe type conversion without ClassCastException

    return value as? T
    // => Bytecode: checkcast instruction + null on failure
}
// => Kotlin: cleaner API (safeCast<String>(value) vs safeCast(value, String.class))

fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    // => List creation: immutable List<Int>
    // => Value: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    // Inline function usage (no lambda allocation)
    val evens = inlineFilter(numbers) { it % 2 == 0 }
    // => Result: [2, 4] (even numbers filtered)
    // => Performance: zero overhead (same as hand-written code)

    println("Evens: $evens")
    // => Output: Evens: [2, 4]

    // Reified type parameter
    val mixed: List<Any> = listOf(1, "two", 3.0, "four", 5)
    // => Heterogeneous list: List<Any> holds different types (Int, String, Double)
    // => Values: Int (1, 5), String ("two", "four"), Double (3.0)

    val strings = filterIsInstance<String>(mixed)
    // => Inline: filterIsInstance body copied here with T = String
    // => Execution: filters [1, "two", 3.0, "four", 5] -> ["two", "four"]
    // => Type safety: strings is List<String> (only String elements)

    println("Strings: $strings")
    // => Output: Strings: [two, four]

    val ints = filterIsInstance<Int>(mixed)
    // => Execution: filters [1, "two", 3.0, "four", 5] -> [1, 5]

    println("Ints: $ints")
    // => Output: Ints: [1, 5]

    // Reified casting
    val value: Any = "Hello"
    // => Variable: type Any (holds String instance)

    val str = safeCast<String>(value)
    // => Safe cast: value as? String with reified T = String
    // => Type check: value is String -> true (String instance)

    val num = safeCast<Int>(value)
    // => Safe cast: value as? Int with reified T = Int
    // => Type check: value is Int -> false (String, not Int)

    println("String cast: $str")
    // => Output: String cast: Hello

    println("Int cast: $num")
    // => Output: Int cast: null

    // Type check at runtime
    fun <T> isType(value: Any): Boolean {

        // return value is T

        return false
    }
    // => Problem: can't use "is T" without reified

    inline fun <reified T> isTypeReified(value: Any): Boolean {

        return value is T
        // => Type check: value is T (works because T is reified)
    }

    println(isTypeReified<String>("test"))
    // => Type check: "test" is String -> true (String literal)
    // => Output: true

    println(isTypeReified<Int>("test"))
    // => Type check: "test" is Int -> false (String, not Int)
    // => Output: false
}
// => Use cases: filtering, casting, type-safe builders, JSON parsing
```

**Key Takeaway**: Inline functions optimize higher-order functions by eliminating lambda allocation; reified type parameters enable runtime type checks and casts in generic functions.

**Why It Matters**: Java lambdas create function objects causing allocation overhead in tight loops, while Kotlin's inline functions eliminate this cost by copying bytecode directly to call sites, making higher-order functions zero-cost abstractions. Reified type parameters solve Java's type erasure problem (can't use `is T` at runtime) enabling generic JSON parsing, dependency injection, and type-safe builders without passing Class<T> parameters, dramatically simplifying library APIs like Gson's fromJson<User>(json) versus Java's fromJson(json, User.class).

    operator fun get(row: Int, col: Int): Int {
        // => Function name: get (conventional name for index access operator [])
        // => Parameters: row and col (two Int indices)
        // => Convention: get for [], set for []= (assignment)

        return rows[row][col]
        // => Nested access: rows[row] gets row list, [col] gets element
        // => Bounds checking: List throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if invalid indices
    }
    // => Use case: 2D arrays, matrices, tables, grids

    // Contains operator
    operator fun contains(value: Int): Boolean {
        // => Function name: contains (conventional name for 'in' operator)
        // => Syntax enabled: value in matrix (membership test)
        // => Parameter: value is Int (element to search for)
        // => Convention: contains for 'in', NOT for '!in' (negation automatic)

        return rows.flatten().contains(value)
        // => Performance: O(n*m) where n = rows, m = columns (linear search)
    }
    // => Syntax: 'in' operator (natural for set/collection semantics)

    // Invoke operator
    operator fun invoke(row: Int): List<Int> {
        // => Parameter: row is Int (row index)

        return rows[row]
        // => Bounds checking: throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if row invalid
    }
}
// => Use cases: mathematical matrices, tables, grid-based data structures

fun main() {
    val p1 = Point(1, 2)
    // => Point creation: data class primary constructor
    // => Values: x = 1, y = 2

    val p2 = Point(3, 4)
    // => Point creation: x = 3, y = 4

    // Unary operator
    val negated = -p1
    // => Execution: Point(-1, -2) (negated coordinates)
    // => Immutability: p1 unchanged (Point(1, 2) still)

    println("Negated: $negated")
    // => Output: Negated: Point(x=-1, y=-2)
    // => String template: interpolates negated Point

    // Binary operators
    val sum = p1 + p2
    // => Execution: Point(1+3, 2+4) = Point(4, 6)
    // => Vector addition: adds coordinates component-wise

    val scaled = p1 * 3
    // => Execution: Point(1*3, 2*3) = Point(3, 6)
    // => Scalar multiplication: scales coordinates by factor 3

    println("Sum: $sum")
    // => Output: Sum: Point(x=4, y=6)

    println("Scaled: $scaled")
    // => Output: Scaled: Point(x=3, y=6)

    // Comparison operators
    println("p1 < p2: ${p1 < p2}")
    // => Execution: p1.compareTo(p2) -> (1²+2²).compareTo(3²+4²) -> 5.compareTo(25) -> negative
    // => Result: negative < 0 -> true (p1 magnitude 5 < p2 magnitude 25)
    // => Output: p1 < p2: true

    println("p1 > p2: ${p1 > p2}")
    // => Result: negative > 0 -> false
    // => Output: p1 > p2: false

    // Matrix operators

        listOf(7, 8, 9)
    ))

    // => Execution: flatten [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] -> [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] -> contains(5) = true
    // => Output: 5 in matrix: true

    println("matrix(2): ${matrix(2)}")
    // => Execution: rows[2] = [7, 8, 9] (third row, 0-indexed)
    // => Output: matrix(2): [7, 8, 9]
}
// => Coverage: unary (-), binary (+, *), comparison (<, >), index ([]), contains (in), invoke (())
```

**Key Takeaway**: Operator overloading enables natural syntax for custom types; implement operators as functions with conventional names like `plus`, `get`, `contains`.

**Why It Matters**: Domain-specific types benefit from mathematical notation (Point + Point, Matrix[i,j]) that makes code self-documenting, yet Java offers no operator overloading forcing verbose method calls (point1.add(point2), matrix.get(i,j)). Kotlin's operator overloading enables natural expressions for mathematical types, collection-like data structures, and DSLs while preventing abuse through limited operator set and explicit operator keyword, balancing expressiveness with readability in scientific computing, game development, and configuration code.

## Example 44: DSL Building with Lambda with Receiver

Create type-safe DSLs using lambda with receiver. The receiver provides implicit `this` context within the lambda, enabling fluent builder APIs with compile-time validation and IDE autocomplete support.

```mermaid

    participant HTML
    participant Head
    participant Body

    Client->>HTML: html lambda invoked
    activate HTML
    HTML->>HTML: Create HTML instance
    HTML->>Head: head lambda called
    activate Head
    Head->>Head: Set title property
    Head-->>HTML: Return head content
    deactivate Head
    HTML->>Body: body lambda called
    activate Body
    Body->>Body: h1 method invoked
    Body->>Body: p method invoked
    Body-->>HTML: Return body content
    deactivate Body
    HTML-->>Client: Return complete HTML
    deactivate HTML
```

```kotlin

    // => Lifecycle: accumulates during DSL execution, read during toString

    fun head(init: Head.() -> Unit) {

        val head = Head()
        // => Initialization: default constructor (title starts as empty string)

        head.init()

        elements.add(head.toString())
        // => Convert configured Head to HTML string and append to elements list
        // => head.toString(): generates "<head><title>VALUE</title></head>"

        body.init()

        elements.add(body.toString())

        // => Immutability: Body configuration captured as string
    }

    override fun toString() = "<html>${elements.joinToString("")}</html>"
    // => toString: render complete HTML document by wrapping elements in <html> tag
    // => Why override: provides custom string representation for HTML object
    // => Output format: "<html><head>...</head><body>...</body></html>"
}

class Head {
    // => Head: DSL builder class for <head> element configuration
    // => Responsibility: stores head metadata (title, meta tags, etc.)
    // => Type safety: only valid head properties exposed

    var title = ""
    // => Default value: empty string (valid HTML - renders <title></title>)

    override fun toString() = "<head><title>$title</title></head>"
    // => toString: render <head> element with configured title
    // => String template: embeds title value in HTML structure
    // => Output: even if title empty, generates valid HTML <head><title></title></head>
}

class Body {
    // => Body: DSL builder class for <body> element with child elements

    private val content = mutableListOf<String>()
    // => content: mutable list storing rendered HTML strings from body elements
    // => Lifecycle: grows during DSL execution (h1, p, ul append strings)

    fun h1(text: String) {

        content.add("<h1>$text</h1>")
        // => Render h1 element and append to content list
        // => String template: embeds text in <h1> tags
        // => Output: "<h1>Welcome</h1>" for text "Welcome"
    }

    fun p(text: String) {

        content.add("<p>$text</p>")
        // => Render paragraph element and append to content list
        // => String template: embeds text in <p> tags
    }

    fun ul(init: UL.() -> Unit) {
        // => Scope nesting: ul block is separate scope from body block

        val ul = UL()
        // => Create new UL instance for list configuration

        ul.init()

        content.add(ul.toString())
        // => Convert configured UL to HTML string and append to body content
        // => ul.toString(): generates "<ul><li>Item 1</li>...</ul>"
    }

    override fun toString() = "<body>${content.joinToString("")}</body>"
    // => Output format: "<body><h1>...</h1><p>...</p><ul>...</ul></body>"
}

class UL {
    // => UL: DSL builder class for <ul> unordered list element

    private val items = mutableListOf<String>()
    // => items: mutable list storing rendered <li> HTML strings

    fun li(text: String) {

        items.add("<li>$text</li>")
        // => Render list item element and append to items list
        // => String template: embeds text in <li> tags
        // => Output: "<li>Item 1</li>" for text "Item 1"
    }

    override fun toString() = "<ul>${items.joinToString("")}</ul>"
    // => Output format: "<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li></ul>"
}

fun html(init: HTML.() -> Unit): HTML {
    // => Entry point: starts DSL execution (html { head { } body { } })
    // => Convention: lowercase name (html) for DSL builders, uppercase (HTML) for classes

    val html = HTML()
    // => Create new HTML instance to receive DSL configuration
    // => Initialization: empty elements list (mutableListOf<String>())

    html.init()

    return html
}

fun main() {
    val page = html {
        // => Scope: outermost DSL scope (head and body are children)

        head {
            // => Scope change: switched from HTML receiver to Head receiver
            // => Type safety: only Head properties (title) available (h1 invalid here)

            title = "My Page"
            // => Effect: sets Head.title to "My Page"
        }
        // => End of head block, Head rendered to "<head><title>My Page</title></head>"
        // => Scope return: receiver switches back to HTML

        body {
            // => Scope change: switched from HTML receiver to Body receiver

            h1("Welcome")
            // => Effect: adds "<h1>Welcome</h1>" to Body.content list

            p("This is a paragraph")
            // => Receiver: implicit this.p(...) (Body receiver)

            ul {
                // => Scope change: switched from Body receiver to UL receiver (nested 2 levels deep)

                li("Item 1")
                // => Effect: adds "<li>Item 1</li>" to UL.items list

                li("Item 2")
                // => Effect: adds "<li>Item 2</li>" to UL.items list

                li("Item 3")
                // => Effect: adds "<li>Item 3</li>" to UL.items list
            }
            // => End of ul block, UL rendered to "<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li></ul>"
            // => Scope return: receiver switches back to Body
            // => Body.content: now contains h1, p, and ul HTML strings
        }
        // => End of body block, Body rendered to "<body><h1>Welcome</h1>...</body>"
        // => Scope return: receiver switches back to HTML
        // => HTML.elements: now contains head and body HTML strings
    }
    // => End of html block, HTML instance returned and assigned to 'page'

    println(page)
    // => elements: ["<head><title>My Page</title></head>", "<body>...</body>"]
    // => joinToString(""): concatenates with no separator
    // => Single line: no formatting/whitespace (production HTML is compact)
    // => Valid HTML: complete document structure (html > head + body)
}
// => Readability: DSL structure mirrors HTML structure (nested blocks = nested elements)
// => Real-world usage: Gradle Kotlin DSL, Ktor routing, Exposed SQL, kotlinx.html
```

**Key Takeaway**: Lambda with receiver (`Type.() -> Unit`) enables type-safe DSLs by providing implicit context where `this` refers to the receiver type; compiler enforces scope-appropriate methods, and IDE autocomplete shows only valid options, making DSL construction safe and discoverable.

**Why It Matters**: Internal DSLs (embedded domain-specific languages) like Gradle Kotlin DSL, Ktor routing, and Exposed SQL queries provide type-safe configuration with compile-time validation, impossible in Java's builder pattern or XML-based configuration where errors appear at runtime. Lambda with receiver enables fluent APIs where methods are available only in appropriate contexts (html { head { title = "..." } } where head is valid only in html scope, title only in head scope), preventing invalid configurations at compile time (compile error for html { li("...") }) and providing IDE autocomplete for valid options, dramatically reducing configuration errors in build scripts (15-20% fewer bugs) and API definitions by catching mistakes during development rather than production.

## Example 45: Sealed Classes and When Expressions

Sealed classes restrict inheritance to a known set of subclasses defined in the same file, enabling exhaustive `when` expressions without `else` branches. The compiler knows all possible subtypes at compile time, providing type-safe state machines and algebraic data types with guaranteed pattern matching completeness.

```kotlin
sealed class NetworkResult<out T> {
    // => NetworkResult: sealed class restricting inheritance to known subclasses
    // => Use cases: API responses, async operations, state machines

    data class Success<T>(val data: T) : NetworkResult<T>()
    // => Success: data class subtype representing successful result
    // => Data class: auto-generates equals(), hashCode(), toString(), copy(), componentN()
    // => Property 'data': holds successful result value (type T)
    // => Covariance: Success<String> is NetworkResult<String> and NetworkResult<Any>
    // => Structural equality: Success("A") == Success("A") is true (data class equality)

    data class Error(val exception: Exception) : NetworkResult<Nothing>()
    // => Error: data class subtype representing failure with exception
    // => Why Nothing: Error has no successful value, Nothing indicates no value possible
    // => Covariance: NetworkResult<Nothing> is subtype of NetworkResult<T> for any T
    // => Property 'exception': holds failure cause (type Exception)

    object Loading : NetworkResult<Nothing>()
    // => Loading: singleton object representing in-progress state
    // => Object: single instance (not data class - no properties to distinguish instances)
    // => Singleton: Loading === Loading is always true (referential equality)
    // => Pattern matching: use 'NetworkResult.Loading ->' (not 'is') for object cases
}

sealed class UIState {
    // => UIState: sealed class for UI screen state machine
    // => State machine: defines valid states, transitions enforced by application logic

    object Idle : UIState()
    // => Idle: singleton representing initial/ready state
    // => State meaning: UI ready for user interaction (not loading, no errors)
    // => Singleton: single instance (Idle === Idle always true)

    object Loading : UIState()
    // => Loading: singleton representing loading/processing state
    // => State meaning: operation in progress (show spinner/progress bar)
    // => Separate from NetworkResult.Loading: different semantic domains (UI vs network)

    data class Success(val message: String) : UIState()
    // => Success: data class representing successful completion with message
    // => Property 'message': success feedback text (e.g., "Saved successfully")
    // => Why data class: message distinguishes different success scenarios
    // => Structural equality: Success("OK") == Success("OK") is true

    data class Error(val error: String) : UIState()
    // => Error: data class representing error state with error message
    // => Property 'error': error message text (e.g., "Connection failed")
    // => Why data class: error distinguishes different failure scenarios
    // => Not Exception: UI error is string message, not exception object
}

fun handleNetworkResult(result: NetworkResult<String>) {
    // => Parameter 'result': NetworkResult<String> (generic sealed class instance)

    when (result) {
        // => Compile-time check: adding new NetworkResult subclass causes error here

        is NetworkResult.Success -> {
            // => Property access: result.data available (String type from Success<String>)
            // => Pattern: 'is' required for data classes (need type check to access properties)

            println("Success: ${result.data}")
            // => Output format: "Success: Data loaded" for data = "Data loaded"
        }

        is NetworkResult.Error -> {
            // => Property access: result.exception available (Exception type)

            println("Error: ${result.exception.message}")
            // => exception.message: access Exception.message (String? - may be null)
            // => Output format: "Error: Network timeout" for exception with message "Network timeout"
        }

        NetworkResult.Loading -> {
            // => No 'is': objects matched by equality (Loading === result), not type check
            // => Singleton: only one Loading instance exists (no properties to distinguish)
            // => Pattern: no 'is' for objects (use qualified name NetworkResult.Loading)

            println("Loading...")
            // => Simple output: no properties to extract from Loading object
            // => State indicator: signals in-progress state to user
        }

    }
}

fun updateUI(state: UIState): String = when (state) {
    // => Parameter 'state': UIState sealed class instance

    UIState.Idle -> "Ready"
    // => Object match: UIState.Idle singleton
    // => Return: "Ready" string for Idle state
    // => No 'is': Idle is object (matched by equality)

    UIState.Loading -> "Please wait..."
    // => Object match: UIState.Loading singleton
    // => Return: "Please wait..." string for Loading state

    is UIState.Success -> "✓ ${state.message}"
    // => Property access: state.message is String (from Success data class)
    // => Return: formatted success message with checkmark (e.g., "✓ Saved successfully")
    // => String template: embeds state.message in output string

    is UIState.Error -> "✗ ${state.error}"
    // => Property access: state.error is String (from Error data class)
    // => Return: formatted error message with X mark (e.g., "✗ Connection failed")
    // => String template: embeds state.error in output string

}

fun main() {
    // Network result handling
    handleNetworkResult(NetworkResult.Success("Data loaded"))
    // => Create Success instance with data "Data loaded"

    handleNetworkResult(NetworkResult.Error(Exception("Network timeout")))
    // => Create Error instance with Exception containing message "Network timeout"

    handleNetworkResult(NetworkResult.Loading)

    // UI state handling
    println(updateUI(UIState.Idle))
    // => Output: Ready (single line)

    println(updateUI(UIState.Loading))
    // => Output: Please wait...

    println(updateUI(UIState.Success("Saved")))
    // => Create Success instance with message "Saved"
    // => Return value: "✓ Saved" (template substitutes state.message)
    // => Output: ✓ Saved

    println(updateUI(UIState.Error("Connection failed")))
    // => Create Error instance with error "Connection failed"
    // => Return value: "✗ Connection failed" (template substitutes state.error)
    // => Output: ✗ Connection failed

    // Sealed class hierarchy is known at compile time
    val states: List<UIState> = listOf(
        // => states: immutable list of UIState instances (List<UIState> type)
        // => Polymorphism: list holds different UIState subtypes (Success, Error, objects)

        UIState.Idle,
        // => Reference Idle singleton, add to list

        UIState.Loading,
        // => Reference Loading singleton, add to list

        UIState.Success("OK"),
        // => Create Success instance with message "OK"

        UIState.Error("Fail")
        // => Create Error instance with error "Fail"
    )
    // => List contents: [Idle, Loading, Success("OK"), Error("Fail")]
    // => Polymorphism: list holds mixed Success/Error/object instances

    states.forEach { state ->

        println(updateUI(state))
        // => Output: one line per state ("Ready", "Please wait...", "✓ OK", "✗ Fail")
    }
    // => Ready (Idle state)
    // => Please wait... (Loading state)
    // => ✓ OK (Success state)
    // => ✗ Fail (Error state)
}
// => Sealed class demonstration complete
// => State machines: perfect for modeling finite state machines with known states
// => Algebraic data types: sealed classes are Kotlin's sum types (Success | Error | Loading)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Sealed classes restrict inheritance to a compile-time-known set of subtypes, enabling exhaustive `when` expressions that must handle all cases without `else` branches; compiler enforces completeness, and adding new subtypes causes compile errors in all pattern matches, guaranteeing no missing case bugs.

**Why It Matters**: Sealed classes provide compiler-enforced exhaustiveness that prevents missing case bugs common in Java's enum-based state machines where forgetting to handle a SUCCESS case crashes production with NullPointerException or silent failures. When combined with when expressions, sealed classes enable functional programming patterns like Result<T,E> types that force explicit error handling without checked exceptions, making API contracts explicit and impossible to ignore. Android developers use sealed classes for screen states (Idle/Loading/Success/Error) where missing state handling would leave UIs stuck showing spinners indefinitely, catching bugs at compile time (0 user reports) rather than discovering through crash analytics after release (thousands of affected users).

## Example 46: Data Class Advanced Features - Copy and Destructuring

Data classes automatically generate `copy()` for immutable updates with named parameters, `componentN()` for destructuring declarations, and value-based `equals()`/`hashCode()`/`toString()` for structural equality and debugging. These features enable functional programming patterns without boilerplate, making immutable data transformations concise and type-safe.

```kotlin
data class User(
    // => User: data class with 4 properties (3 required, 1 default)

    val id: Int,
    // => Required: no default value, must provide in constructor

    val name: String,
    // => Required: must provide in constructor

    val email: String,
    // => component3(): destructuring extracts email as third component
    // => Required: must provide in constructor

    val role: String = "user"
    // => component4(): destructuring extracts role as fourth component
    // => Override: can specify role = "admin" in constructor or copy()
)

data class Point3D(val x: Double, val y: Double, val z: Double)
// => Point3D: simple data class with 3 Double properties
// => component1/2/3: destructuring extracts x, y, z in order

fun main() {
    val user1 = User(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com")

    // Automatic toString()
    println(user1)
    // => Auto-generated: data class toString() format is "ClassName(prop1=value1, prop2=value2, ...)"

    // Automatic equals() (structural equality)
    val user2 = User(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com")

    println("user1 == user2: ${user1 == user2}")
    // => Output: user1 == user2: true (same values)

    println("user1 === user2: ${user1 === user2}")
    // => Output: user1 === user2: false (different objects)
    // => Use case: === rarely needed for data classes (use == for value comparison)

    // copy() with modifications
    val user3 = user1.copy(email = "newalice@example.com")
    // => Copied properties: id=1, name="Alice", role="user" copied from user1

    println("Modified user: $user3")
    // => Immutability proof: user1 and user3 are separate instances with different emails

    val admin = user1.copy(role = "admin")
    // => Use case: promote user to admin without modifying original
    // => Immutability: user1 still has role="user"

    println("Admin user: $admin")
    // => Comparison: only role differs from user1 (admin vs user)

    // Destructuring declaration
    val (id, name, email, role) = user1

    println("Destructured: ID=$id, Name=$name, Email=$email, Role=$role")
    // => id: 1 (Int, from user1.component1())
    // => name: "Alice" (String, from user1.component2())
    // => role: "user" (String, from user1.component4())

    // Partial destructuring (ignore components)
    val (userId, userName) = user1
    // => userId: user1.component1() = 1 (Int)
    // => userName: user1.component2() = "Alice" (String)
    // => Ignored: component3() (email) and component4() (role) not extracted

    println("Partial: ID=$userId, Name=$userName")

    // Destructuring in loops
    val users = listOf(
        // => users: immutable list of User instances
        // => Size: 3 users

        User(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com"),

}
// => Data class features demonstration complete
// => Key insight: data classes eliminate boilerplate for value objects
// => Conciseness: ~20 lines of boilerplate saved per data class vs Java
```

**Key Takeaway**: Data classes auto-generate `copy()` for immutable updates with named parameters, `componentN()` for destructuring declarations, and value-based `equals()`/`hashCode()`/`toString()` for structural equality; `copy()` enables functional programming patterns by creating modified copies instead of mutation, and destructuring reduces verbosity when unpacking multiple properties.

**Why It Matters**: Immutable updates in Java require manual builder patterns (20+ lines per class) or AutoValue annotation processing boilerplate, while Kotlin's copy() enables functional update patterns with named parameters (user.copy(email = newEmail)) in a single line, keeping code concise and preventing accidental mutations that cause bugs in concurrent code. Destructuring declarations reduce ceremony when unpacking data (val (id, name, email) = user in 1 line vs Java's 3 lines val id = user.getId(); val name = user.getName(); val email = user.getEmail()), critical in functional transformations and pattern matching where extracting multiple fields from objects is ubiquitous, improving readability by 40-60% in data processing pipelines handling thousands of records per second where verbose property access becomes unreadable noise.

        "Keyboard" to 79.99                  // => Pair("Keyboard", 79.99) becomes Map.Entry
    )                                        // => productMap is Map<String, Double>, size=3
                                             // => Map.Entry has component1() (key) and component2() (value)

    }

    // => Output: Keyboard (ID 3): $79.99 -> $87.99 with 10% markup
}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Destructuring in lambdas enables concise parameter extraction from data classes, pairs, triples, and map entries using `componentN()` functions; use underscore `_` to skip unwanted components.

**Why It Matters**: Lambda parameter destructuring eliminates verbose property extraction (`products.forEach { product -> val id = product.id; val name = product.name }`) replacing it with inline extraction (`products.forEach { (id, name, _) -> }`), reducing boilerplate by 60-70% in collection processing code. Map iteration becomes self-documenting (`map.forEach { (key, value) -> }`) compared to Java's verbose `Entry<K,V>` extraction, critical in configuration processing, JSON transformation, and analytics queries where extracting multiple fields is ubiquitous. The underscore notation for ignored components makes intent explicit, preventing accidental variable shadowing in nested iterations.

## Example 48: Inline Classes (Value Classes) for Type Safety

Inline classes provide zero-overhead type-safe wrappers. They're inlined to underlying type at runtime, avoiding object allocation.

```kotlin
// Simple value class (inlined at runtime)

// Value class with validation
@JvmInline
value class Email(val value: String) {      // => Wraps String with email validation
    init {                                   // => Init block runs at construction
        require(value.contains("@")) { "Invalid email: $value" }
                                             // => require() throws IllegalArgumentException if false
                                             // => Impossible to create Email("notanemail") - fails at construction
    }

    fun domain(): String = value.substringAfter("@")
}

// Value class with private property
@JvmInline
value class Password(private val value: String) {
                                             // => Private value prevents external access to raw password

```

**Key Takeaway**: Value classes provide compile-time type safety without runtime overhead through inlining to underlying types; they prevent primitive obsession, enforce validation at construction, and enable zero-cost wrappers with methods.

**Why It Matters**: Primitive obsession (using `Int` for UserId, String for Email) causes type confusion bugs where developers pass parameters in wrong order or mix unrelated IDs (passing productId where orderId expected), crashing production systems with silent data corruption. Value classes provide compile-time type safety (can't pass Email where UserId expected) with zero runtime cost through inlining, unlike Java where wrapper classes cause allocation overhead (millions of allocations per second in high-throughput systems). This enables domain modeling that makes illegal states unrepresentable (can't construct invalid Email without "@") while maintaining raw type performance, critical in financial systems where mixing account IDs crashes transactions and in trading platforms where allocation overhead destroys latency budgets (microsecond targets).

## Example 49: Contracts for Smart Casts

Contracts inform the compiler about function behavior, enabling smart casts and improved type inference.

```kotlin

// Contract: returns(true) implies non-null

fun String?.isNotNullOrEmpty(): Boolean {    // => Extension on nullable String (String?)
        returns(true) implies (this@isNotNullOrEmpty != null)
                                             // => this@isNotNullOrEmpty labels the receiver explicitly
    }
    return this != null && this.isNotEmpty()
}

// Contract: returns() implies non-null (throws otherwise)
@OptIn(ExperimentalContracts::class)

**Key Takeaway**: Contracts enable custom functions to influence compiler's smart cast and nullability analysis through `returns(true) implies`, `returns() implies`, and `callsInPlace` guarantees; essential for validation functions and control flow utilities that need smart casting.

**Why It Matters**: Kotlin's compiler smart-casts variables after null checks (`if (x != null) { x.length }`), but custom validation functions don't trigger smart casts without contracts, forcing redundant null assertions (`x!!.length` after `if (isValid(x))`) that defeat the type system's safety guarantees. Contracts tell the compiler about function guarantees (`returns(true) implies (this@isNotNull != null)`), enabling the same smart casting for custom validators that standard library functions enjoy. This eliminates fighting the type system in validation-heavy code (authentication checks, input sanitization, business rules) where developers would otherwise choose between redundant assertions (unsafe `!!`) or verbose safe calls (`?.`), improving both safety and ergonomics in production validation logic. The `callsInPlace` contract prevents "variable might not be initialized" warnings when lambdas initialize variables, enabling cleaner DSL implementations in frameworks (testing, configuration builders) where initialization order is guaranteed but not inferrable without contracts.

## Example 50: Type Aliases for Readability

Type aliases create alternative names for existing types, improving code readability without runtime overhead. Unlike value classes that create new types at compile time, type aliases are purely compile-time substitutions with zero runtime cost.

```kotlin
// Simplify complex types with type aliases
typealias UserMap = Map<Int, String>
// => Map<Int, String>: target type being aliased (existing type)
// => Type equivalence: UserMap and Map<Int, String> are IDENTICAL types (interchangeable)
// => Use case: simplify complex generic types that appear repeatedly in codebase

typealias Predicate<T> = (T) -> Boolean

typealias Handler<T> = (T) -> Unit

typealias ValidationResult = Pair<Boolean, String>
// => Alias for Pair<Boolean, String>: represents validation outcome
// => Boolean component: success/failure flag
// => String component: validation message (error or success description)
// => Use case: structured validation results without creating data class
// => Alternative: data class ValidationResult(val isValid: Boolean, val message: String)
// => Trade-off: type alias lighter weight, data class provides named properties

// Domain-specific aliases (primitive obsession solution)
typealias UserId = Int
// => Alias for Int representing user ID
// => Use case: gradual migration path (add alias now, migrate to value class later)

typealias Timestamp = Long
// => Semantic clarity: Timestamp documents that Long represents time, not arbitrary number
// => Interoperability: identical to Long (can pass to Java APIs expecting Long)

typealias JsonString = String
// => Alias for String containing JSON data
// => Documentation: signals that String contains JSON, not plain text
// => Alternative: value class for stricter validation, sealed class for parsing states

class UserRepository {
    private val users: UserMap = mapOf(
        // => UserMap: type alias for Map<Int, String> (more readable in domain context)
        1 to "Alice",
        2 to "Bob",
        3 to "Charlie"
    )
    // => Alias assignment: UserMap and Map<Int, String> are interchangeable

    fun findUser(predicate: Predicate<String>): List<String> {
        // => Parameter: predicate of type Predicate<String> (alias for (String) -> Boolean)
        // => Readability: Predicate<String> clearer than (String) -> Boolean
        // => Compilation: predicate becomes (String) -> Boolean in bytecode
        // => Type equivalence: can assign (String) -> Boolean to Predicate<String>
        return users.values.filter(predicate)
        // => users.values: Collection<String> (map values)
        // => Return: List<String> of matching values
    }

    fun processUser(id: UserId, handler: Handler<String>) {
        // => Parameter id: UserId (alias for Int, documents semantic meaning)
        // => Parameter handler: Handler<String> (alias for (String) -> Unit)
        // => Signature clarity: intent clearer than processUser(id: Int, handler: (String) -> Unit)
        // => Type safety: UserId and Int are identical (can pass any Int)
        users[id]?.let(handler)
        // => users[id]: nullable String? (map lookup may fail)
        // => let(handler): invokes handler with non-null user name
    }

    fun validateUserId(id: UserId): ValidationResult {
        // => Parameter: UserId (documents that Int represents user ID)
        // => Return: ValidationResult (alias for Pair<Boolean, String>)
        // => Signature: clearer than validateUserId(id: Int): Pair<Boolean, String>
        val exists = id in users
        // => exists: Boolean indicating if user ID exists in map
        val message = if (exists) "Valid user" else "User not found"
        // => message: String describing validation result
        return exists to message
        // => Return: Pair instance assigned to ValidationResult (identical types)
    }
}

// Generic type alias for function composition
typealias StringTransformer = (String) -> String

fun applyTransformations(input: String, vararg transformers: StringTransformer): String {
    // => Parameter input: initial String value
    // => Type clarity: StringTransformer clearer than (String) -> String
    var result = input
    for (transformer in transformers) {
        result = transformer(result)
        // => Side effect: updates result with transformation output
    }
    return result
}

fun main() {
    val repo = UserRepository()
    // => Instantiate: UserRepository with default users map
    // => users field: initialized with 3 users (Alice, Bob, Charlie)

    // Using type aliases in function calls
    val filtered = repo.findUser { it.startsWith("A") }
    // => filtered: List<String> containing ["Alice"] (only name starting with "A")
    println("Filtered users: $filtered")
    // => Output: Filtered users: [Alice]
    // => String template: embeds filtered list in output string

    repo.processUser(1) { name ->
        println("Processing: $name")
        // => Output: Processing: Alice
    }

    val (valid, message) = repo.validateUserId(1)
    // => Destructuring: extracts Boolean and String from ValidationResult (Pair)
    // => valid: Boolean (true because user ID 1 exists)
    // => message: String ("Valid user")
    println("Validation: $message (valid=$valid)")
    // => Output: Validation: Valid user (valid=true)
    // => String template: embeds message and valid flag

    // Type alias for function types (composition pattern)
    val uppercase: StringTransformer = { it.uppercase() }
    // => Type assignment: (String) -> String assigned to StringTransformer (identical)

    val addExclamation: StringTransformer = { "$it!" }
    // => String template: "$it!" constructs new string with exclamation

    val addPrefix: StringTransformer = { ">>> $it" }

    val result = applyTransformations(
        "hello",
        uppercase,
        addExclamation,
        addPrefix
    )
    // => vararg expansion: uppercase, addExclamation, addPrefix packed into array
    // => Sequential application:
    // =>   1. uppercase("hello") -> "HELLO"
    // =>   2. addExclamation("HELLO") -> "HELLO!"
    // =>   3. addPrefix("HELLO!") -> ">>> HELLO!"
    // => result: ">>> HELLO!" (final transformed string)
    println("Transformed: $result")
    // => Output: Transformed: >>> HELLO!

    // Type aliases don't create new types (demonstration of type equivalence)
    val userId: UserId = 123
    // => UserId: type alias for Int
    // => Assignment: Int literal 123 directly assignable to UserId (no conversion)
    val regularInt: Int = userId
    // => Assignment: UserId value assigned to Int (no conversion needed)
    // => No wrapper: zero overhead (no boxing, no object creation)
    println("User ID: $userId, Int: $regularInt")
    // => Output: User ID: 123, Int: 123
}

// => Type alias compilation behavior:
// => Bytecode: NO trace of type aliases (fully erased, replaced with target types)
// => Type checking: errors show alias names (improves error messages)

// => Type alias vs value class comparison:
// => Type alias:
// =>   - NO type safety (aliases are identical to underlying types)
// =>   - Documentation only (clarifies intent, no enforcement)
// =>   - Interchangeable with underlying type (implicit conversion)
// => Value class:
// =>   - Type safety (distinct type, no implicit conversion)
// =>   - Requires explicit construction (value class UserId(val value: Int))
// =>   - Prevents mixing different value classes of same underlying type

// => Type alias use cases:
// => 1. Simplify complex generic types: typealias UserCache = Map<UserId, Pair<User, Timestamp>>
// => 2. Document intent: typealias Email = String (documents String represents email)
// => 3. Gradual migration: add alias now, migrate to value class later
// => 5. Reduce duplication: avoid repeating Map<String, List<Int>> dozens of times
// => 6. Interoperability: maintain compatibility with Java (aliases erase to Java types)

// => Type alias limitations:
```

**Key Takeaway**: Type aliases improve code readability for complex or frequently used types without creating new types or runtime overhead; they are purely compile-time substitutions that document intent without enforcing type safety.

**Why It Matters**: Complex generic types like Map<Int, List<Pair<String, Double>>> obscure intent and make refactoring error-prone when the same type appears dozens of times across a codebase, forcing developers to mentally parse nested generics at every usage site. Type aliases (typealias UserScores = Map<Int, List<Pair<String, Double>>>) document intent while enabling global type changes through a single declaration, critical in large codebases where domain models evolve and refactoring touches hundreds of files. Unlike value classes that create new types with compile-time overhead and boxing concerns, aliases are zero-cost abstractions that disappear at compile time, enabling gradual migration from primitive types to domain types without breaking existing code or sacrificing performance.

## Example 51: Nothing Type for Exhaustiveness

`Nothing` is Kotlin's bottom type representing computation that never returns normally (always throws exception or enters infinite loop). It's a subtype of every type, enabling smart casts and exhaustive when expressions without dummy values.

```kotlin
// Function that always throws exception (returns Nothing)
fun fail(message: String): Nothing {
    throw IllegalStateException(message)
}

// Function that exits process (returns Nothing)
fun exitProgram(): Nothing {
    // => Use case: CLI applications with fatal errors
    println("Exiting...")
    kotlin.system.exitProcess(1)
    // => Exit code 1: indicates error (convention: 0 = success, non-zero = failure)
    // => Nothing satisfaction: exitProcess satisfies Nothing return type (never completes)
}

sealed class Result<out T> {
    // => Covariance (out T): can assign Result<Int> to Result<Number> (safe for reading)
    data class Success<T>(val value: T) : Result<T>()
    // => Success case: contains value of type T
    data class Error(val message: String) : Result<Nothing>()
    // => Error case: Result<Nothing> (no value, only error message)
    // => Covariance benefit: Result<Nothing> is subtype of Result<T> for any T
    // => Use case: represents failure state without requiring dummy value
}
// => Alternative: data class Error<T>(val message: String) : Result<T>() (requires dummy T)

fun processValue(value: Int?): Int {
    // => Parameter: nullable Int? (may be null)
    val nonNull = value ?: fail("Value cannot be null")
    // => Left side: value (Int?)
    return nonNull + 10
}
// => Alternative without Nothing: value?.let { it + 10 } ?: throw Exception() (verbose)

fun calculate(result: Result<Int>): Int = when (result) {
    is Result.Success -> result.value
    // => Pattern match: Success case extracts value (type Int)
    is Result.Error -> fail(result.message)
}
// => Nothing role: fail() satisfies Int return type (Nothing is bottom type)

fun main() {
    // Nothing in smart cast demonstration
    try {
        processValue(5)
        // => Argument: non-null Int 5
        // => Result: 5 + 10 = 15
        println("Result: ${processValue(5)}")
        // => Output: Result: 15
    } catch (e: IllegalStateException) {
        // => Catch block: handles IllegalStateException from fail()
        // => Not executed: processValue(5) doesn't throw (5 is non-null)
        println("Caught: ${e.message}")
    }

    try {
        processValue(null)
        // => Argument: null (Int?)
    } catch (e: IllegalStateException) {
        // => Catch block: handles exception from fail()
        // => Executed: processValue(null) throws exception
        println("Caught: ${e.message}")
    }

    // Nothing in sealed class exhaustiveness
    val success = Result.Success(42)
    // => Success instance: Result<Int> containing value 42
    println("Calculate success: ${calculate(success)}")
    // => Output: Calculate success: 42

    val error = Result.Error("Computation failed")
    // => Covariance: Result<Nothing> is subtype of Result<Int>
    // => Type compatibility: can pass to calculate(result: Result<Int>)
    try {
        calculate(error)
    } catch (e: IllegalStateException) {
        // => Catch block: handles exception from fail()
        println("Caught: ${e.message}")
        // => Output: Caught: Computation failed
    }

    // Nothing as universal subtype (type hierarchy demonstration)
    val list1: List<String> = emptyList()
    // => Assignment: List<Nothing> assigned to List<String>
    // => Subtyping: Nothing is subtype of String, so List<Nothing> is subtype of List<String>
    // => Covariance: List is covariant in its element type (List<out E>)
    val list2: List<Int> = emptyList()
    // => Assignment: List<Nothing> assigned to List<Int>
    // => Universal compatibility: emptyList() works for any List<T>
    println("Empty lists: $list1, $list2")
    // => Output: Empty lists: [], []
    // => Both empty: same underlying empty list instance (optimization)

    // TODO() function returns Nothing (development aid)
    fun notImplemented(): Int {
        // => Implementation: not yet written (placeholder)
        TODO("Implement this function")
        // => Type compatibility: Nothing satisfies Int return type (bottom type)
        // => Parameter: message describing what needs implementation
    }

    try {
        notImplemented()
        // => TODO() behavior: throws NotImplementedError immediately
    } catch (e: NotImplementedError) {
        // => Catch block: handles NotImplementedError from TODO()
        // => NotImplementedError: special exception type for unimplemented code
        println("Caught: ${e.message}")
        // => Message format: "An operation is not implemented: <custom message>"
    }
}

// => Nothing type theory (bottom type in type hierarchy):
// => 2. Inhabited: NO values exist of type Nothing (empty type, no instances)

// => Nothing vs Unit comparison:
// => Nothing:
// =>   - No instances exist (uninhabited type)
// =>   - Use case: control flow that never completes (fail(), TODO(), exitProcess())
// => Unit:
// =>   - Single instance: Unit object (inhabited by one value)

// => Nothing in type system (formal properties):
// => Type lattice: Nothing is bottom element (⊥ in type theory)
// => Empty set: Nothing represents empty set of values (no inhabitants)
// => Type soundness: ensures type safety (impossible states represented by Nothing)

// => Practical applications of Nothing:
// => 4. Development markers: TODO(), error(), NotImplementedError for incomplete code
// => 5. Process termination: exitProcess() for CLI applications
// => 6. Generic error types: Result<Nothing> for universal error representation

// => TODO(message: String): Nothing - marks unimplemented code
// => error(message: Any): Nothing - throws IllegalStateException with message

```

**Key Takeaway**: `Nothing` is Kotlin's bottom type (subtype of all types) that represents computation never returning normally; it enables smart casts in null checks and exhaustive when expressions without dummy values.

**Why It Matters**: Nothing type solves the "impossible state" problem that plagues type systems without bottom types, where error branches in when expressions require dummy return values (return 0 for errors in Int-returning functions) that pollute code with meaningless sentinels. Kotlin's Nothing enables fail() functions that satisfy any return type through subtyping (Nothing <: T for all T), allowing when expressions on sealed classes to handle errors with exceptions rather than impossible defaults, improving both safety and clarity. The compiler's knowledge that Nothing-returning functions never complete enables smart casts after null checks (val x: Int = nullable ?: fail("null") makes x non-nullable), eliminating redundant !! assertions that bypass type safety, critical in validation-heavy code where assertion functions enforce preconditions without fighting the type system.

## Example 52: Companion Object Extensions

Companion object extensions add static-like factory methods to existing classes without modifying source code. They enable extending third-party library classes with custom constructors while preserving namespace clarity (Class.method() syntax).

```kotlin
class User(val id: Int, val name: String, val role: String) {
    // => Visibility: public by default (accessible from anywhere)

    companion object {
        // => Naming: anonymous (no name), referenced as User.Companion
        // => Scope: can access private members of User class

        fun create(name: String): User {
            // => Parameter: name only (id and role defaulted)
            return User(generateId(), name, "user")
            // => Default role: "user" for standard creation
        }

        private var nextId = 1
        // => Visibility: private (only companion object can access)
        // => Alternative: AtomicInteger for thread-safe ID generation

        private fun generateId() = nextId++
        // => Visibility: private (implementation detail)
    }

    override fun toString() = "User(id=$id, name=$name, role=$role)"
    // => toString(): overrides Any.toString() for custom representation
    // => Use case: debugging, logging, display
}

// Extension function on companion object
fun User.Companion.admin(name: String): User {
    // => Extension target: User's companion object (NOT User instances)
    return User(1000, name, "admin")
    // => Fixed ID: 1000 (admin users have IDs in 1000+ range)
    // => Role: "admin" (hardcoded for admin factory)
    // => ID strategy: separate range from auto-generated IDs (avoids collisions)
}

fun User.Companion.guest(): User {
    return User(9999, "Guest", "guest")
    // => Special ID: 9999 (reserved for guest users)
    // => Name: "Guest" (default guest name)
    // => Role: "guest" (minimal privileges)
}

fun User.Companion.fromPair(pair: Pair<Int, String>): User {
    // => Parameter: pair containing (id, name)
    // => Use case: interoperability with code returning Pair
    val (id, name) = pair
    // => Destructuring: extracts id (Int) and name (String) from pair
    return User(id, name, "imported")
    // => name: from pair
    // => Role: "imported" (indicates user created from external data)
}
// => Naming convention: from* prefix for conversion factories (fromPair, fromJson, fromXml)

fun main() {
    // Using original companion object methods
    val user1 = User.create("Alice")
    // => user1: User(id=1, name=Alice, role=user)
    val user2 = User.create("Bob")
    // => user2: User(id=2, name=Bob, role=user)
    println("Created users: $user1, $user2")
    // => Output: Created users: User(id=1, name=Alice, role=user), User(id=2, name=Bob, role=user)

    // Using extension methods on companion object
    val admin = User.admin("Charlie")
    // => Syntax identical: User.admin() looks same as User.create() (seamless API)
    // => admin: User(id=1000, name=Charlie, role=admin)
    println("Admin user: $admin")
    // => Output: Admin user: User(id=1000, name=Charlie, role=admin)

    val guest = User.guest()
    // => guest: User(id=9999, name=Guest, role=guest)
    println("Guest user: $guest")
    // => Output: Guest user: User(id=9999, name=Guest, role=guest)

    val imported = User.fromPair(500 to "David")
    // => fromPair: converts Pair to User
    // => ID: 500 (from pair, not auto-generated)
    // => imported: User(id=500, name=David, role=imported)
    println("Imported user: $imported")
    // => Output: Imported user: User(id=500, name=David, role=imported)

    // All factory methods available through unified interface
    val users = listOf(
        User.create("Eve"),
        User.admin("Frank"),
        User.guest()
    )
    // => Namespace: clean single entry point (no separate factory class)
    users.forEach { println(it) }
    // => Output:
    // =>   User(id=3, name=Eve, role=user)
    // =>   User(id=1000, name=Frank, role=admin)
    // =>   User(id=9999, name=Guest, role=guest)
}

// => Companion object extension mechanics:
// => Access: extensions CANNOT access private companion members
// => Import: extensions require import if defined in different package

// => Companion object vs extension comparison:
// =>   - Can access private class and companion members
// =>   - Part of class definition (source modification required)
// =>   - Higher priority in resolution (shadows extensions)
// => Companion extensions:
// =>   - CANNOT access private members (public API only)
// =>   - Can extend library classes (no source modification)

// => Use cases for companion object extensions:
// => 1. Third-party libraries: add factories to classes you don't own
// => 2. Module separation: define factories in separate module from core class
// => 4. Domain-specific factories: add factories relevant to specific contexts

// => Limitations and considerations:
// => 3. Discoverability: extensions require import (may be hidden from autocomplete)
// => 4. Naming conflicts: multiple modules may define same extension (ambiguity)

// => User.Companion: explicit reference to companion object (instance)
// => User.Companion.admin(): extension on companion (explicit receiver)
// => Companion instanceof: User.Companion is singleton object instance

// => 1. JSON conversion: fun User.Companion.fromJson(json: String): User
// => 3. Named constructors: fun User.Companion.withDefaults(): User
// => 4. Test fixtures: fun User.Companion.fixture(id: Int = 1): User
// => 5. Migration helpers: fun User.Companion.fromLegacy(legacy: OldUser): User
// => 6. Fluent API: fun User.Companion.new(init: User.() -> Unit): User

// => Extension (User.admin("name")):
// =>   - Namespace: grouped under User class
// =>   - Clarity: clearly factory for User (User.admin vs createAdminUser)
// =>   - Organization: factories colocated with class (logical grouping)
// => Top-level (createAdminUser("name")):
// =>   - Namespace: pollutes package-level namespace
// =>   - Discoverability: harder to find (search for "User" doesn't help)
// =>   - Naming: needs prefix to avoid conflicts (createAdminUser, newAdminUser)
// =>   - Organization: factories scattered across files (poor cohesion)

// => Extension shadowing demonstration:
// => If User.Companion defined: fun admin(name: String): User { ... }

// => Advanced: named companion objects:
// => class User {
// =>     companion object Factory { // Named companion
// =>         fun create(name: String): User = User(1, name, "user")
// =>     }
// => }
// => Reference: User.Factory (explicit name) or User.Companion (still works)
```

**Key Takeaway**: Companion object extensions add static-like factory methods to existing classes without source modification, enabling library extension while preserving clean namespace (Class.method() syntax) and IDE discoverability.

**Why It Matters**: Library classes with restricted constructors (private/internal) force factory pattern usage, yet adding factory methods requires modifying the class (impossible for third-party libraries) or creating separate factory classes that pollute the namespace and hide methods from IDE autocomplete. Companion object extensions solve this by enabling User.admin("name") syntax on classes you don't own, maintaining the same ergonomics as built-in companion methods while allowing domain-specific factories in separate modules. This pattern is critical in plugin architectures where core classes must remain unchanged but plugins need to add construction methods, and in testing where test fixtures (User.fixture()) shouldn't pollute production companion objects but need the same clean syntax.

## Example 53: Delegation Pattern with by Keyword

Implement interfaces by delegating to contained objects using `by` keyword, eliminating boilerplate forwarding methods.

```kotlin
interface Repository {
    // => Interface: defines contract for data persistence operations
    fun save(data: String)
    // => save: persists data to storage
    // => Parameter: data to store (String)
    // => Return: Unit (no return value, side effect only)
    fun load(): String
    // => load: retrieves data from storage
    // => Return: String (stored data or default value)
    // => Contract: implementation decides what to return when empty
    fun delete()
    // => delete: removes data from storage
    // => Return: Unit (side effect only)
    // => Contract: implementation decides cleanup behavior
}

class DatabaseRepository : Repository {
    // => Storage: private var storage (nullable String, represents database state)
    // => Use case: base implementation without caching or logging
    private var storage: String? = null
    // => storage: nullable String (null = no data stored)
    // => Visibility: private (implementation detail, not exposed to clients)
    // => Initial state: null (empty database)

    override fun save(data: String) {
        // => Override: implements Repository.save contract
        // => Parameter: data (String to persist)
        println("Saving to database: $data")
        // => Output: "Saving to database: [data]"
        storage = data
        // => State change: storage transitions from null/old value to new data
        // => Persistence: data now stored (simulated database write)
    }

    override fun load(): String {
        // => Override: implements Repository.load contract
        // => Return: stored data or "No data" if empty
        println("Loading from database")
        // => Output: "Loading from database"
        // => Debugging: indicates actual database access (not cached)
        return storage ?: "No data"
        // => Null handling: provides default value instead of throwing exception
    }

    override fun delete() {
        // => Override: implements Repository.delete contract
        println("Deleting from database")
        // => Output: "Deleting from database"
        // => Debugging: confirms delete operation executed
        storage = null
        // => Mutation: sets storage to null (clears data)
        // => State change: storage transitions to empty state
        // => Cleanup: simulates database record deletion
    }
}

// Delegate all Repository methods to repo, override specific ones
class CachedRepository(
    // => Use case: add caching layer without modifying DatabaseRepository
    private val repo: Repository             // => Delegate
    // => repo: Repository instance to delegate to (DatabaseRepository or any Repository)
    // => Visibility: private (implementation detail)
    // => Immutability: val (reference doesn't change, but repo state can)
    // => Boilerplate elimination: no manual forwarding code needed (Java requires explicit delegation)
    // => Interface implementation: CachedRepository IS-A Repository (polymorphism)
    // => Composition: HAS-A Repository (repo field)
    private var cache: String? = null
    // => Visibility: private (implementation detail)
    // => Mutability: var (modified by load and delete operations)
    // => Initial state: null (empty cache)

        // => Override: replaces delegated load() with caching logic
        // => Return: cached data or freshly loaded data
        return cache ?: run {
            // => Elvis + run: if cache null, execute block to load from repo
            // => Lazy loading: only access database if cache empty
            val data = repo.load()           // => Delegate to underlying repo
            // => Database access: occurs only on cache miss
            // => data: String returned from database ("No data" or actual data)
            cache = data                     // => Cache result
            // => Mutation: stores loaded data in cache
            // => State change: cache transitions from null to populated
            // => Performance: subsequent loads avoid database access
            println("Cached data")
            // => Output: "Cached data"
            // => Debugging: indicates cache was populated
            data
            // => Return: data from database (also stored in cache)
        }
    }

    override fun delete() {
        // => Override: replaces delegated delete() with cache-aware logic
        // => Strategy: clear cache AND delegate to repo
        cache = null                         // => Clear cache
        // => Mutation: resets cache to null (empty state)
        // => Invalidation: ensures subsequent load() fetches fresh data
        // => State change: cache transitions to empty
        repo.delete()                        // => Delegate to underlying repo
        // => Database deletion: removes data from underlying storage
        // => Consistency: cache and database both cleared
    }

    // save() is fully delegated (no override)
    // => No caching: save operations don't populate cache (cache only on read)
}

interface Logger {
    // => Interface: defines logging contract
    fun log(message: String)
    // => log: outputs message to logging destination
    // => Parameter: message (String to log)
    // => Return: Unit (side effect only)
    // => Contract: implementation decides output format and destination
}

class ConsoleLogger : Logger {
    override fun log(message: String) {
        // => Override: implements Logger.log contract
        // => Output: formatted message with [LOG] prefix
        println("[LOG] $message")
        // => Output format: "[LOG] [message]"
    }
}

// Delegate Logger to logger, Repository to repo
class LoggingRepository(
    // => Multiple delegation: implements TWO interfaces via delegation
    // => Composition: contains both Repository and Logger instances
    private val repo: Repository,
    // => Visibility: private (implementation detail)
    private val logger: Logger
    // => Visibility: private (implementation detail)
) : Repository by repo, Logger by logger {   // => Multiple delegation
    // => Multiple interfaces: implements BOTH Repository AND Logger
    // => Polymorphism: LoggingRepository IS-A Repository AND IS-A Logger
    // All Repository methods delegated to repo
    // All Logger methods delegated to logger
}

fun main() {
    val db = DatabaseRepository()
    // => Initial state: storage = null (empty database)
    // => db: base repository without caching
    val cached = CachedRepository(db)
    // => Decorator construction: wraps db with caching behavior
    // => Delegation: cached.repo = db (repository to delegate to)
    // => Initial cache state: cache = null (empty cache)

    // First load (from database)
    // => Cache check: cache is null (cache miss)
    // => Database output: "Loading from database"
    // => Return from db: "No data" (storage is null)
    // => Cache update: cache = "No data"
    // => Caching output: "Cached data"
    // => Return: "No data"

    cached.save("Important data")            // => Delegated to db: Saving to database: Important data
    // => Database output: "Saving to database: Important data"
    // => State change: db.storage = "Important data"
    // => Cache state: cache remains "No data" (save doesn't update cache)
    // => Strategy: cache populated on read, not write

    // Second load (from cache)
    // => Issue: cache is STALE ("No data" cached but db has "Important data")
    // => Design flaw: save() doesn't invalidate cache (write-through not implemented)
    // => Production issue: read-through cache without write invalidation causes stale reads
    // => Solution: invalidate cache on save (cache = null in override save())

    cached.delete()                          // => Output: Deleting from database
    // => Cache invalidation: cache = null (clears cached data)
    // => Database output: "Deleting from database"
    // => State change: db.storage = null (database emptied)
    // => Consistency: cache and database both empty
    // => Database output: "Loading from database"
    // => Cache update: cache = "No data"
    // => Caching output: "Cached data"
    // => Return: "No data"

    println("\n--- Logging Repository ---")
    // => Output: newline and section header
    val logger = ConsoleLogger()
    val loggingRepo = LoggingRepository(DatabaseRepository(), logger)
    // => Multiple delegation: implements Repository AND Logger

    loggingRepo.log("Starting operation")    // => Output: [LOG] Starting operation
    // => Output: "[LOG] Starting operation"
    // => Multiple interfaces: loggingRepo IS-A Logger (via delegation)
    loggingRepo.save("Data")                 // => Output: Saving to database: Data
    // => Database output: "Saving to database: Data"
    // => State change: repo.storage = "Data"
    // => Multiple interfaces: loggingRepo IS-A Repository (via delegation)
    loggingRepo.log("Operation complete")    // => Output: [LOG] Operation complete
    // => Output: "[LOG] Operation complete"
}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Class delegation with `by` eliminates boilerplate forwarding methods; ideal for decorator pattern and cross-cutting concerns like caching or logging.

**Why It Matters**: Decorator pattern in Java requires manually forwarding every interface method to the delegateobject, creating hundreds of lines of boilerplate that must be maintained when interfaces evolve. Kotlin's by keyword eliminates this entirely (class Cached(repo: Repository) : Repository by repo), automatically forwarding all methods while allowing selective override for decoration. This enables zero-boilerplate cross-cutting concerns (logging, caching, metrics) critical in production microservices where instrumenting repositories, HTTP clients, and data sources is essential for observability.

## Example 54: Destructuring Declarations Advanced

Destructuring works with any class providing `componentN()` functions. Customize destructuring for domain objects.

```kotlin
class Credentials(val username: String, val password: String, val token: String) {
    // => Custom class: stores authentication credentials (not data class)
    // => Use case: credentials with custom destructuring behavior
    // => Destructuring: requires manual componentN() implementation (no auto-generation)
    // Custom componentN() for destructuring
    operator fun component3() = token        // => Third component
    // => Limit: can define component4(), component5(), etc. but readability degrades
}

data class Range(val start: Int, val end: Int) {
    // => Data class: auto-generates componentN(), equals(), hashCode(), toString(), copy()
    // => Properties: start (Int), end (Int) - inclusive range boundaries
    // Data class auto-generates component1() and component2()
    // => Generated code: operator fun component1() = start; operator fun component2() = end
    // => Limitation: only properties in primary constructor get componentN() (not body properties)

    // Custom iteration support
    operator fun iterator() = (start..end).iterator()
    // => .iterator(): IntRange provides iterator() implementation
}

class Response(val statusCode: Int, val headers: Map<String, String>, val body: String) {
    // => Custom class: HTTP response with statusCode, headers, body
    // => Not data class: has custom destructuring logic (transforms headers)
    // => Properties: statusCode (Int), headers (Map), body (String)
    // Destructure into specific components
    // => Custom logic: component2() extracts Content-Type header (not entire headers map)
    // => Transformation: headers map → single header value
    operator fun component1() = statusCode
    operator fun component2() = headers["Content-Type"] ?: "unknown"
    // => component2: extracts Content-Type header (NOT entire headers map)
    // => Transformation: Map<String, String> → String (specific header value)
    // => Default: "unknown" if Content-Type header absent (Elvis operator)
    operator fun component3() = body
    // => Usage: val (status, contentType, body) = response
}

fun main() {
    // Destructuring custom class
    val creds = Credentials("user123", "pass456", "token789")
    // => creds: Credentials instance (custom class with componentN())
    // => Properties: username="user123", password="pass456", token="token789"
    // => Compilation: val username = creds.component1(); val password = creds.component2(); val token = creds.component3()
    // => username: String = "user123" (from component1())
    // => password: String = "pass456" (from component2())
    // => token: String = "token789" (from component3())
    // => Syntactic sugar: concise extraction of multiple properties
    println("User: $username, Pass: $password, Token: $token")
    // => Output: "User: user123, Pass: pass456, Token: token789"

    // Partial destructuring
    // => user: String = "user123" (from component1())
    // => pass: String = "pass456" (from component2())
    // => Use case: extract subset of properties (username/password without token)
    println("Login: $user/$pass")            // => Output: Login: user123/pass456
    // => String template: interpolates user and pass
    // => Output: "Login: user123/pass456"

    // Destructuring in function parameters
    fun authenticate(credentials: Credentials): String {
        // => Parameter: credentials (Credentials instance)
        // => Return: String (authentication result message)
        val (u, p, _) = credentials          // => Destructure, ignore token
        // => Destructuring: extracts username and password
        // => u: String = credentials.component1() (username)
        // => p: String = credentials.component2() (password)
        // => _: underscore discards third component (token not needed)
        // => Use case: authenticate with username/password only (token not used in auth logic)
        return "Authenticated: $u"
        // => Return: authentication message with username
    }
    println(authenticate(creds))             // => Output: Authenticated: user123
    // => Output: "Authenticated: user123"

    // Data class destructuring
    val range = Range(1, 5)
    val (start, end) = range                 // => Auto-generated component1(), component2()
    // => Destructuring: extracts start and end
    // => start: Int = range.component1() = 1
    // => end: Int = range.component2() = 5
    println("Range: $start to $end")         // => Output: Range: 1 to 5
    // => String template: interpolates start and end
    // => Output: "Range: 1 to 5"

    // Destructuring in for loop with custom iterator
    for (value in range) {
        // => Iterator: IntRange.iterator() (1..5)
        print("$value ")                     // => Output: 1 2 3 4 5
        // => Total output: "1 2 3 4 5 "
    }
    println()

    // Destructuring complex response
    val response = Response(
        200,
        // => statusCode: 200 (HTTP OK)
        mapOf("Content-Type" to "application/json", "Server" to "Kotlin"),
        // => headers: Map with two entries (Content-Type, Server)
        "{\"status\": \"ok\"}"
        // => body: JSON string (escaped quotes)
    )
    val (status, contentType, body) = response
    // => Destructuring: extracts status, Content-Type header, body
    // => status: Int = response.component1() = 200
    // => body: String = response.component3() = "{\"status\": \"ok\"}"
    // => Transformation: headers map → single header value (component2 logic)
    println("Status: $status, Type: $contentType, Body: $body")
    // => String template: interpolates three extracted values

    // List of destructurable objects
    val responses = listOf(
        // => List creation: three Response instances
        Response(200, mapOf("Content-Type" to "text/html"), "<html>"),
        // => Response 1: 200 OK, text/html, HTML body
        Response(404, mapOf("Content-Type" to "text/plain"), "Not found"),
        // => Response 2: 404 Not Found, text/plain, error message
        Response(500, mapOf("Content-Type" to "application/json"), "{\"error\":true}")
        // => Response 3: 500 Internal Server Error, application/json, JSON error
    )
    // => responses: List<Response> (three elements)

    responses.forEach { (status, type, body) ->
        // => status: Int (component1() of current Response)
        // => body: String (component3() of current Response)
        println("$status ($type): ${body.take(20)}")
        // => String template: formats status, type, truncated body
    }
    // => Output:
    // 200 (text/html): <html>
    // 404 (text/plain): Not found
    // 500 (application/json): {"error":true}
    // => Third response: 500 status, JSON content type, JSON error body
}
```

**Key Takeaway**: Implement `componentN()` operators to enable destructuring for custom classes; provides concise syntax for unpacking complex objects.

**Why It Matters**: Custom destructuring enables domain objects to participate in Kotlin's destructuring syntax, improving readability when unpacking complex types (HTTP responses, database rows, configuration objects). Unlike Java where accessing multiple properties requires verbose getter chains, destructuring provides natural tuple-like semantics (val (status, headers, body) = response) that make sequential property access self-documenting. This pattern is essential in functional transformations and pattern matching where extracting specific fields from objects is common, reducing cognitive load in data processing code.
