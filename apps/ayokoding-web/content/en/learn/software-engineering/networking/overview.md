### Introduction to Networking

**[Introduction](/en/learn/software-engineering/networking/introduction)** provides a comprehensive foundation in computer networking:

- **Networking Basics** - What networks are and how they transmit data
- **Packets and Protocols** - How data is structured and transmitted
- **Network Layers** - Understanding the OSI and TCP/IP models
- **IP Addressing** - IPv4, IPv6, and address allocation
- **TCP vs UDP** - Connection-oriented vs connectionless protocols
- **DNS** - Domain name resolution and hierarchy
- **HTTP/HTTPS** - Web protocol fundamentals
- **Network Devices** - Routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers
- **Network Security** - TLS/SSL, VPNs, firewalls

## Why Networking Matters

Software engineers need networking knowledge for:

- **Application Development** - Building web apps, APIs, and microservices
- **Troubleshooting** - Diagnosing connectivity and performance issues
- **Performance Optimization** - Understanding latency, bandwidth, CDNs
- **Security** - Implementing TLS, understanding attack vectors
- **Cloud Computing** - Working with AWS, Azure, GCP networking services
- **Distributed Systems** - Designing scalable, fault-tolerant architectures

## What You'll Understand

After completing the networking introduction, you'll understand:

- How your web requests reach servers across the internet
- Why some applications use TCP while others use UDP
- How DNS translates domain names to IP addresses
- What happens when you type a URL in your browser
- How HTTPS secures communication
- How load balancers distribute traffic
- Basic network troubleshooting approaches

## Getting Started

Start with the **[Introduction](/en/learn/software-engineering/networking/introduction)** to build foundational networking knowledge. This introduction assumes no prior networking experience and teaches concepts through clear explanations and diagrams.

The content focuses on practical networking knowledge relevant to software development, not exhaustive protocol specifications or network administration details.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of how computers and the internet work
- No prior networking knowledge required
- Helpful (but not required): Experience with web development or APIs
