description: Introduction to Linux command-line tutorials covering hands-on learning through annotated examples
---

The Linux Command-Line tutorials provide practical, hands-on learning for developers who want to master shell usage, scripting, and automation. These tutorials emphasize real-world applications and direct code exploration.

## Tutorial Structure

This section offers a code-first learning approach through the **by-example** tutorial methodology. Rather than lengthy explanations, you'll learn Linux command-line skills through annotated, working examples that demonstrate actual usage patterns.

### By Example Tutorial

The [By Example tutorial](/en/learn/software-engineering/linux-platform/shell/tutorials/by-example) provides comprehensive coverage of Linux command-line fundamentals through 75-90 annotated examples. This approach suits experienced developers who prefer learning through code exploration.

**What you'll learn:**

- Shell basics, file operations, and text processing
- Process management and system monitoring
- Shell scripting with variables, loops, and functions
- Automation techniques using cron and systemd
- Development workflows with Git and build tools

**Who it's for:**

- Developers with programming experience
- Professionals transitioning to Linux environments
- Engineers seeking command-line automation skills
- Anyone comfortable learning from annotated code examples

## Tutorial Philosophy

These tutorials follow a **learning-by-doing** approach:

- **Code-first presentation** - Examples before theory
- **Annotated commands** - Inline comments explain syntax and behavior
- **Progressive complexity** - Basic patterns to advanced techniques
- **Real-world scenarios** - Practical commands used in actual work
- **Immediate applicability** - Copy, modify, and use in your projects

## Prerequisites

All tutorials assume:

- Access to a Linux environment (WSL, VM, or native installation)
- Familiarity with terminal emulator usage
- Basic programming knowledge (variables, conditionals, loops)
- Text editor proficiency

No prior shell scripting experience required - the examples teach through demonstration.

## Getting Started

Start with the [By Example tutorial](/en/learn/software-engineering/linux-platform/shell/tutorials/by-example) to learn Linux command-line skills through annotated, practical examples. Work through the examples at your own pace, experimenting with commands and adapting them to your needs.

## Content Status

The by-example tutorial structure is in place and under active development. Content will include comprehensive coverage of command-line patterns, shell scripting fundamentals, text processing workflows, and automation techniques.
