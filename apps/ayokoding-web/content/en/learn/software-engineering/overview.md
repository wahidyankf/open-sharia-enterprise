---

Build your software engineering expertise with structured learning paths covering modern programming languages and system design.

## What You'll Learn

- **Programming Languages** - Deep dives into Python, Golang, Java, Kotlin, Rust, and Elixir with tutorials from basics to advanced topics
- **System Design** - Learn to architect scalable, reliable systems through real-world examples
- **Data** - Master data concepts and tools including databases, data structures, and processing frameworks
- **Platforms** - Master web frameworks, cloud platforms, Kubernetes, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD systems

Each topic follows the Diátaxis framework with tutorials (learning-oriented), how-to guides (problem-solving), reference (technical lookup), and explanations (conceptual understanding).
