**Solve common Java problems quickly with step-by-step guides.** This section provides practical, actionable solutions for real-world enterprise and object-oriented development challenges.

## What's in How-To Guides

### Cookbook

[Java Cookbook](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/java/how-to/cookbook) - 30+ copy-paste-ready recipes organized by category:

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy, Observer patterns
- **Collections Framework**: List manipulation, Set operations, Map transformations, Stream API
- **Exception Handling**: Try-with-resources, custom exceptions, error recovery patterns
- **Concurrency**: Thread pools, ExecutorService, CompletableFuture, synchronization
- **File I/O**: Path operations, NIO.2, BufferedReader/Writer, resource management
- **Testing**: JUnit patterns, mocking, test data builders, assertions
- **String Processing**: StringBuilder optimization, regex patterns, formatting
- **Debugging**: Logging frameworks, stack trace analysis, remote debugging

**Use when**: You need a quick solution to a specific problem without extensive explanation.
