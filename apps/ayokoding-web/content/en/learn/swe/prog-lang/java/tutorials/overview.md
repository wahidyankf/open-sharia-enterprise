**Want to learn Java systematically?** These 5 progressive tutorials take you from installation to expert-level Java mastery, with comprehensive coverage of object-oriented design, JVM fundamentals, and enterprise patterns.

## 📚 Tutorial Levels

### Level 1: Initial Setup (0-5%)

[Initial Setup for Java](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/java/tutorials/initial-setup)

**Coverage**: 0-5% of Java knowledge

**What you'll learn**: Install JDK (Java Development Kit), configure your development environment, set JAVA_HOME, verify installation, run your first "Hello, World!" program with javac and java commands.

**Prerequisites**: None - complete beginner friendly

**Estimated length**: 400-500 lines

---

### Level 2: Quick Start (5-30%)

[Java Quick Start](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/java/tutorials/quick-start)

**Coverage**: 5-30% of Java knowledge

**What you'll learn**: 10 essential Java concepts through focused touchpoint examples - variables and types, classes and objects, methods, access modifiers, inheritance, interfaces, exception handling, collections, generics, and file I/O.

**Prerequisites**: Initial Setup complete

**Estimated length**: 750-900 lines

---

### Level 3: Beginner (0-60%)

[Complete Beginner's Guide to Java](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/java/tutorials/beginner)

**Coverage**: 0-60% of Java knowledge

**What you'll learn**: Comprehensive Java fundamentals including object-oriented programming principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism), collections framework (List, Set, Map), exception handling with try-catch-finally, streams and lambda expressions, JUnit testing, and package organization. Includes extensive Mermaid diagrams for OOP visualization.

**Prerequisites**: Quick Start recommended (or programming experience)

**Estimated length**: 1,700-2,300 lines

---

### Level 4: Intermediate (60-85%)

[Intermediate Java](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/java/tutorials/intermediate)

**Coverage**: 60-85% of Java knowledge

**What you'll learn**: Production-grade Java with design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Builder, Strategy), SOLID principles in practice, concurrency with threads and executors, build tools (Maven/Gradle), JDBC database access, logging frameworks, and dependency injection with Spring basics.

**Prerequisites**: Beginner tutorial (strong OOP foundation required)

**Estimated length**: 1,350-1,700 lines

---

### Level 5: Advanced (85-95%)

[Advanced Java](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/java/tutorials/advanced)

**Coverage**: 85-95% of Java knowledge

**What you'll learn**: Expert-level topics including JVM internals and garbage collection, reflection and annotations, bytecode manipulation, performance profiling and optimization, advanced concurrency patterns, microservices architecture, and system design with Java.

**Prerequisites**: Intermediate tutorial (mastery of design patterns, SOLID, and concurrency required)

**Estimated length**: 1,250-1,500 lines

## 🎯 Choosing Your Tutorial

| Your Background             | Start Here                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Never programmed before     | Initial Setup → Beginner                        |
| Programmer, new to Java     | Quick Start → Beginner → Intermediate           |
| Experienced with Python     | Quick Start → Beginner (OOP will be different)  |
| Experienced with C++        | Quick Start → Intermediate (similar paradigms)  |
| Want production Java skills | Intermediate → Advanced                         |
| Building enterprise systems | Through Advanced (design patterns critical)     |
| Building web services       | Through Intermediate (Spring/JDBC essential)    |
| Building microservices      | Through Advanced (architecture patterns needed) |
| Moving from Kotlin          | Beginner (review fundamentals) → Intermediate   |

## ☕ Java's Design Philosophy

Java was designed with "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) in mind. The JVM abstracts platform differences, letting your code run on any system with a JVM. Our tutorials:

- **Introduce OOP early** (Quick Start) to build solid design foundations
- **Provide extensive diagrams** (Mermaid visualizations) for class relationships
- **Use progressive disclosure** - simple examples before complex patterns
- **Include many exercises** to reinforce object-oriented thinking
- **Link concepts together** showing how OOP enables maintainable enterprise systems
- **Emphasize industry practices** - design patterns, SOLID principles, testing

The initial discipline of explicit typing and verbose syntax pays off with maintainable, scalable, enterprise-grade applications.

## 🏢 Java in Enterprise

Java dominates enterprise development for good reasons:

- **Mature ecosystem**: Millions of libraries, frameworks, and tools
- **Platform independence**: JVM runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, cloud platforms
- **Strong typing**: Catches errors at compile time, not runtime
- **Backward compatibility**: Code written 20 years ago still runs today
- **Enterprise patterns**: Battle-tested design patterns for large systems
- **Professional tooling**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Maven, Gradle, Spring ecosystem

Our tutorials prepare you for real-world enterprise development, not just language syntax.

## 📖 How to Use These Tutorials

1. **Read sequentially** within each tutorial (sections build on each other)
2. **Type all code examples** yourself - don't copy-paste for best retention
3. **Complete exercises** before moving to next section
4. **Study Mermaid diagrams** carefully (especially OOP class relationships)
5. **Run JUnit tests** for every example - testing is fundamental to Java
6. **Use the Cookbook** for quick patterns while learning
