## Tutorial Structure

Each language follows a consistent learning path:

1. **Initial Setup** (0-5%) - Get the language installed and running
2. **Quick Start** (5-30%) - Learn core syntax to explore independently
3. **Beginner** (0-60%) - Comprehensive fundamentals from scratch
4. **Intermediate** (60-85%) - Production techniques for real systems
5. **Advanced** (85-95%) - Expert mastery of internals and optimization
6. **Cookbook** (Parallel track) - Practical recipes for common problems

## Learning Approach

- **Hands-on**: Learn by building real projects
- **Progressive**: Start simple, gradually increase complexity
- **Practical**: Focus on real-world applications
- **Complete**: Full coverage from basics to advanced topics
