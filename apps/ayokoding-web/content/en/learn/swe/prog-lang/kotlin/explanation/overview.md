description: Understanding Kotlin philosophy, best practices, and common pitfalls
---

**Understand the "why" behind Kotlin patterns and practices.** This section explores Kotlin's design philosophy, best practices, and common mistakes.

## What's in Explanation

### Best Practices

[Kotlin Best Practices and Design Principles](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/kotlin/explanation/best-practices)

Learn idiomatic Kotlin through proven patterns:

- What makes Kotlin special (design philosophy)
- Code organization best practices
- Naming conventions
- Null safety idioms
- Function design patterns
- Coroutine best practices
- Collection operation patterns
- Testing practices
- Documentation standards

**Format**: Principle → Rationale → Good Example → Bad Example → Exceptions

### Anti-Patterns

[Common Kotlin Anti-Patterns](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/kotlin/explanation/anti-patterns)

Avoid common mistakes with clear examples:

- Java developer migration pitfalls
- Null safety violations
- Coroutine misuse patterns
- Performance anti-patterns
- Type system misuse
- Code organization issues

**Format**: Name → Why Problematic → Bad Example → Better Approach → Context

**Severity levels**: Critical, Major, Minor

## Purpose of Explanation Documents

Explanation documents differ from tutorials and how-to guides:

| Tutorials             | How-To Guides             | Explanation                  |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **What** to learn     | **How** to solve problems | **Why** things work this way |
| Step-by-step learning | Step-by-step solutions    | Conceptual understanding     |
| Build knowledge       | Achieve goals             | Deepen understanding         |

## When to Use Explanation

- **Learning idioms**: Understand what makes code "Kotlinic"
- **Making decisions**: Choose between approaches based on principles
- **Code review**: Identify patterns and anti-patterns
- **Team standards**: Establish shared conventions
- **Avoiding pitfalls**: Learn from common mistakes
