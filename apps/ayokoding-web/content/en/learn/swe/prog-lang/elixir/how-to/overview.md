# Overview

Practical, copy-paste-ready solutions for common Elixir challenges. From pattern matching to Phoenix APIs.

## What Are How-To Guides?

How-To guides provide:

- **Problem-focused**: Specific challenges you face
- **Solution-oriented**: Working code you can adapt
- **Practical**: Real-world scenarios
- **Concise**: Quick answers, not lengthy explanations

## Available Resources

### Cookbook (Position 3)

**35-40 recipes** organized by category for quick reference:

- **Data Structures**: Working with lists, maps, structs
- **Concurrency**: Processes, GenServer, Supervisor patterns
- **Error Handling**: Result tuples, with/else, supervision
- **OTP**: GenServer, Supervisor, Application patterns
- **Phoenix**: Controllers, LiveView, channels, authentication
- **Ecto**: Queries, changesets, associations, migrations
- **Testing**: ExUnit patterns, mocks, property testing
- **Performance**: Profiling, benchmarking, optimization

Each recipe follows:

1. **Problem**: What you're trying to solve
2. **Solution**: Working code
3. **How It Works**: Brief explanation
4. **Use Cases**: When to apply this pattern

## How to Use These Guides

**When You Have a Specific Problem:**

1. Check the Cookbook first for quick recipes
2. Browse specialized guides for deeper coverage
3. Cross-reference to tutorials for foundational concepts

**When Learning:**

- Use alongside tutorials as practical reinforcement
- Try recipes to understand concepts hands-on
- Adapt solutions to your own projects

## Cookbook vs Tutorials

**Cookbook:**

- Problem → Solution format
- Assumes basic knowledge
- Quick reference
- Copy-paste ready

**Tutorials:**

- Concept → Example format
- Teaches from basics
- Progressive learning
- Explanatory focus

Use both together: Tutorials for understanding, Cookbook for application.
