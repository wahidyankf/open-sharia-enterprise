description: Complete learning path from zero to expert Rust development - 5 comprehensive tutorials covering 0-95% knowledge
---

**Your complete journey from zero to expert Rust developer.** This full set provides 5 comprehensive tutorials taking you from initial setup through expert-level mastery, with emphasis on Rust's unique ownership system and memory safety.

## 🎯 Where Rust Fits in Your Learning Journey

**Rust is recommended for developers** seeking systems programming with safety guarantees. Rust introduces a unique ownership model that prevents memory bugs at compile time while delivering performance comparable to C and C++.

**Why Rust?** Rust solves the longstanding trade-off between safety and performance. Its ownership system prevents data races, null pointer dereferences, and memory leaks without requiring a garbage collector. This makes Rust ideal for systems programming, web services, WebAssembly, embedded systems, and blockchain infrastructure.

**What's next?** After mastering Rust, explore specialized domains like embedded systems, WebAssembly development, or high-performance web services. See [Programming Languages Overview](/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/overview) for the complete learning path.
