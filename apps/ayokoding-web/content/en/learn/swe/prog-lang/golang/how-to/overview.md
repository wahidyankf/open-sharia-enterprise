## When to Use How-To vs Tutorials

| Use How-To Guides          | Use Tutorials                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Solving a specific problem | Learning systematically          |
| Quick reference            | Building comprehensive knowledge |
| Production code            | Understanding fundamentals       |
| "How do I...?" questions   | "What is...?" questions          |
