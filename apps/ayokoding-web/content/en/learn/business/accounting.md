## 📖 Section 1: The Accounting Equation - Your Foundation

Every accounting system in the world is built on one simple equation. Master this, and everything else will make sense.

### The Magic Equation

$$
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}
$$

**What does this mean?**

- **Assets** = What the business owns (cash, equipment, inventory, etc.)
- **Liabilities** = What the business owes (loans, bills to pay, etc.)
- **Equity** = What the owners own (investment + profits)

**Why it always balances:**

Think of it this way: Everything a business owns (assets) was either borrowed (liabilities) or invested/earned by the owners (equity). There's no other source of money!

### Real-World Example

Let's start Tech Haven:

**Transaction 1:** Owner invests $10,000 cash to start the business.

```
Before:
Assets = $0
Liabilities = $0
Equity = $0

After:
Assets = $10,000 (cash)
Liabilities = $0
Equity = $10,000 (owner investment)

Check: $10,000 = $0 + $10,000 ✓
```

**Transaction 2:** Business borrows $5,000 from bank.

```
After:
Assets = $15,000 (cash increased by $5,000)
Liabilities = $5,000 (bank loan)
Equity = $10,000 (unchanged)

Check: $15,000 = $5,000 + $10,000 ✓
```

**Transaction 3:** Business buys equipment for $3,000 cash.

```
After:
Assets = $15,000 ($12,000 cash + $3,000 equipment)
Liabilities = $5,000 (unchanged)
Equity = $10,000 (unchanged)

Check: $15,000 = $5,000 + $10,000 ✓
```

**Notice:** Assets changed form (cash → equipment) but total stayed the same!

### Visual Representation

 style E fill:#029E73,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
 style Sum fill:#DE8F05,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
```

### ✓ Checkpoint

**What you've learned:**

- The accounting equation is the foundation of all accounting
- Assets = Liabilities + Equity ALWAYS
- Every transaction affects at least two parts of the equation
- The equation must always balance

**Practice:** If a business has $50,000 in assets and $20,000 in liabilities, what is the equity?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

$$
\text{Equity} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = \$50,000 - \$20,000 = \$30,000
$$

</details>

## 📖 Section 2: Double-Entry Bookkeeping - The System That Never Lies

Now that you understand the equation, let's learn the system that keeps it balanced automatically.

### The Core Principle

**Every transaction has two sides:**

- Something received (debit)
- Something given (credit)

**The rule:** For every transaction, total debits = total credits

This isn't opinion or preference—it's the mathematical law that makes accounting work.

### Account Types and Their Normal Balances

Different types of accounts increase and decrease differently:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
 subgraph "Asset Accounts"
  A1[Debit = Increase]
  A2[Credit = Decrease]
  A1 --> A2
 end

 subgraph "Liability Accounts"
  L1[Credit = Increase]
  L2[Debit = Decrease]
  L1 --> L2
 end

 subgraph "Equity Accounts"
  E1[Credit = Increase]
  E2[Debit = Decrease]
  E1 --> E2
 end

 subgraph "Revenue Accounts"
  R1[Credit = Increase]
  R2[Debit = Decrease]
  R1 --> R2
 end

 subgraph "Expense Accounts"
  X1[Debit = Increase]
  X2[Credit = Decrease]
  X1 --> X2
 end

 style A1 fill:#0173B2,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
 style L1 fill:#DE8F05,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
 style E1 fill:#029E73,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
 style R1 fill:#CC78BC,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
 style X1 fill:#DE8F05,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
```

**Memory aid:**

- **DEAD CLIC** (Debit: Expenses, Assets, Drawings | Credit: Liabilities, Income, Capital)
- Assets and Expenses behave the same (debit increases)
- Liabilities, Equity, and Revenue behave the same (credit increases)

⚠️ **Common Mistake**: Many beginners try to think "debit = bad, credit = good" from everyday banking language. **This doesn't work in accounting!**

In accounting:

- **Debits are NOT bad** - they just mean "left side"
- **Credits are NOT good** - they just mean "right side"

Think of debits and credits as **directions** (left vs right) rather than value judgments (good vs bad).

**Tip**: Focus on memorizing what each side increases:

- Left (Debit) increases: Assets & Expenses
- Right (Credit) increases: Liabilities, Equity & Revenue

Once you know this, you can figure out what decreases each account (opposite side).

### Why This Makes Sense

Think about your personal checking account:

- When you **deposit** money (increase asset), the bank **debits** your account
- When you **withdraw** money (decrease asset), the bank **credits** your account

This seems backward because you're looking at the bank's books, not yours! From the bank's perspective, your deposit is their **liability** (they owe you), so they credit it.

### Recording Transactions

**Transaction:** Tech Haven pays $800 cash for rent.

**Analysis:**

1. What happened? Cash decreased, rent expense increased
2. Which accounts? Cash (asset), Rent Expense (expense)
3. Debit or credit? Cash decreases (credit), Rent Expense increases (debit)

**Journal Entry:**

```
Date: Jan 5, 2025
Description: Paid monthly rent

Account                 Debit    Credit
Rent Expense            $800
  Cash                           $800

(To record payment of monthly rent)
```

**Check:**

- Total debits = $800
- Total credits = $800
- ✓ Balanced!

### Practice Entry

**Transaction:** Tech Haven repairs a customer's computer and receives $150 cash.

**Try it yourself before looking:**

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```
Date: Jan 6, 2025
Description: Computer repair service

Account                 Debit    Credit
Cash                    $150
  Service Revenue                $150

(To record repair service revenue)
```

**Why?**

- Cash increased (asset increase = debit)
- Service Revenue increased (revenue increase = credit)

</details>

### ✓ Checkpoint

**What you've learned:**

- Every transaction has equal debits and credits
- Assets and expenses increase with debits
- Liabilities, equity, and revenue increase with credits
- The system self-checks because debits must equal credits

## 📖 Section 3: Chart of Accounts - Organizing Your Records

Before we start recording lots of transactions, we need an organized filing system for our accounts.

### What Is a Chart of Accounts?

A **chart of accounts** is a complete list of all accounts your business uses, organized by type and numbered for easy reference.

### Standard Numbering System

```
1000-1999: Assets
2000-2999: Liabilities
3000-3999: Equity
4000-4999: Revenue
5000-5999: Expenses
```

### Tech Haven's Chart of Accounts

```
ASSETS (1000-1999)
1000 - Cash
1100 - Accounts Receivable
1200 - Inventory (Computer Parts)
1300 - Prepaid Rent
1500 - Equipment
1550 - Accumulated Depreciation - Equipment

LIABILITIES (2000-2999)
2000 - Accounts Payable
2100 - Bank Loan Payable
2200 - Unearned Revenue

EQUITY (3000-3999)
3000 - Owner's Capital
3100 - Owner's Drawings
3900 - Retained Earnings

REVENUE (4000-4999)
4000 - Service Revenue
4100 - Parts Sales Revenue

EXPENSES (5000-5999)
5000 - Rent Expense
5100 - Utilities Expense
5200 - Wages Expense
5300 - Supplies Expense
5400 - Depreciation Expense
5500 - Interest Expense
```

### Visual Organization

 style X1 fill:#DE8F05,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
```

### Why Numbering Matters

**Benefits:**

- **Organization:** Assets always start with 1, revenue with 4, etc.
- **Sorting:** Computer systems can automatically sort by account type
- **Scalability:** Can add accounts between existing numbers (1150, 1160, etc.)
- **Communication:** Everyone knows what "account 1000" means

### ✓ Checkpoint

**What you've learned:**

- Chart of accounts organizes all business accounts
- Standard numbering: 1000s (assets), 2000s (liabilities), 3000s (equity), 4000s (revenue), 5000s (expenses)
- Numbering allows for easy expansion and organization
- Each business customizes their chart based on needs

**You now understand:**

You've mastered the first three building blocks of accounting! You know:

1. **The accounting equation** - the fundamental rule (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
2. **Double-entry bookkeeping** - how to keep the equation balanced (debits and credits)
3. **Chart of accounts** - how to organize financial information

Next, you'll put these concepts into practice by recording real business transactions!

## 📖 Section 4: Recording Transactions - Your First Month

Now we'll record Tech Haven's first month of business transactions step by step.

### Journal Entry Format

Every journal entry includes:

1. **Date** of transaction
2. **Account names** (debit accounts listed first)
3. **Amounts** (debits in left column, credits in right column, indented)
4. **Description** explaining the transaction

```

**Note:** Two entries needed - one for the sale revenue, one for the cost of inventory sold.

⚠️ **Common Mistake**: When selling inventory, beginners often forget to record the cost of goods sold. **Always make TWO entries**:

## 📖 Section 5: The General Ledger - Tracking Account Balances

After recording transactions in the journal, we organize them by account to track balances.

### What Is the General Ledger?

The **general ledger** collects all transactions for each account, showing:

- All debits and credits to the account
- Running balance
- Complete transaction history

### Posting to Ledger Accounts

**Posting** means transferring journal entries to their respective ledger accounts.

### Sample Ledger: Cash (Account 1000)

```

**✓ Check:** Debits ($15,850) = Credits ($15,850)

### What the Trial Balance Tells You

**If it balances:**

- ✓ All journal entries posted correctly
- ✓ No arithmetic errors
- ✓ Ready to prepare financial statements

**If it doesn't balance:**

- ❌ Look for posting errors
- ❌ Check for transposition errors (reversed digits)
- ❌ Find missing entries

### Trial Balance Limitations

**What it CATCHES:**

- Mathematical errors
- Missing postings
- Wrong debit/credit columns

**What it DOESN'T CATCH:**

- Wrong account used
- Wrong amounts (if debits still equal credits)
- Duplicate entries
- Completely omitted transactions

### ✓ Checkpoint

**What you've learned:**

- Trial balance verifies debits equal credits
- It's prepared before financial statements
- It catches posting and arithmetic errors
- It doesn't catch all types of errors

**Progress Check:**

You're now ready for the most important part - creating financial statements! You've completed the entire accounting process from transactions to trial balance:

1. ✓ Recorded transactions in journal entries
2. ✓ Posted entries to the general ledger
3. ✓ Verified accuracy with trial balance

Next, you'll transform these numbers into the three core financial statements that tell Tech Haven's complete financial story!

                                               --------
NET INCREASE IN CASH                           $8,825

CASH AT BEGINNING OF MONTH                     $0
                                               --------

                                               ========
```

**What it tells us:**

- Operations used $2,675 cash (normal for startups)
- Investing used $3,000 (equipment purchase)
- Financing provided $14,500 (owner + loan)
- Ending cash: $8,825 (matches balance sheet)

### How Statements Connect

**Key connections:**

1. Income Statement net income → Balance Sheet equity
2. Cash Flow Statement ending cash → Balance Sheet cash
3. All three tell parts of the same financial story

### ✓ Checkpoint

**What you've learned:**

- Income statement shows profitability (revenue - expenses)
- Balance sheet shows financial position (assets = liabilities + equity)
- Cash flow statement shows cash movement (operating, investing, financing)
- The three statements interconnect

**Practice:** If Tech Haven earned $2,000 service revenue next month with same expenses, what would net income be?

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```
Revenue: $2,000 + $400 (parts) = $2,400
Expenses: $800 + $600 + $100 + $25 + $250 = $1,775

Net Income = $2,400 - $1,775 = $625

The business would be profitable!

## 📖 Section 8: Accounting Principles - The Foundation

Understanding the principles that guide accounting decisions.

### 1. Accrual Basis vs. Cash Basis

**Cash Basis:**

- Record revenue when cash received
- Record expenses when cash paid
- Simple but can be misleading

**Accrual Basis (standard for businesses):**

- Record revenue when **earned**
- Record expenses when **incurred**
- Matches revenues and expenses properly

**Example:** Tech Haven completes $300 repair on Jan 12, customer pays Jan 25.

**Cash Basis:**

```
Jan 12: No entry
Jan 25: Cash 300 / Service Revenue 300
```

**Accrual Basis:**

```
Jan 12: Accounts Receivable 300 / Service Revenue 300
Jan 25: Cash 300 / Accounts Receivable 300
```

**Why accrual is better:** Shows true economic activity regardless of cash timing.

### 2. Matching Principle

**Rule:** Match expenses to the revenues they helped generate

**Example:** Tech Haven buys $2,000 parts but only sells $250 worth in January.

**Correct approach:**

- Record $2,000 as Inventory (asset)
- When sold, expense only $250 (Cost of Goods Sold)
- Keep remaining $1,750 as inventory

**Why it matters:** Shows accurate profit for each period.

### 3. Revenue Recognition Principle

**Rule:** Recognize revenue when earned, not when cash received

**Criteria:**

1. Service/product delivered
2. Amount is measurable
3. Collection reasonably certain

### 4. Going Concern Principle

**Rule:** Assume business continues operating indefinitely

**Impact:**

- Value assets at cost, not liquidation value
- Depreciate long-term assets over useful life

### 5. Consistency Principle

**Rule:** Use same accounting methods period to period

**Why:** Allows meaningful comparison between periods.

### 6. Materiality Principle

**Rule:** Only account for items that influence decisions

**Example:** $5 stapler can be expensed immediately rather than treated as long-term asset.
