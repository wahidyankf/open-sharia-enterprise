# 🌙 Open Sharia Enterprise

✨ An enterprise solutions platform for Sharia-compliant business systems.

🌐 **Live Sites**:

- **OSE Platform** ([oseplatform.com](https://oseplatform.com)) - Main platform website (under construction)
- **AyoKoding** ([ayokoding.com](https://ayokoding.com)) - Educational content platform for software engineering

> ⚠️ **PRE-ALPHA STATUS**: This project is in early development and **NOT ready for production use**. Core architecture and patterns are still being established. APIs and implementations may change significantly. **Contributions and pull requests are not being accepted** at this time.

## 🎯 Motivation

**The Challenge**: Organizations worldwide need enterprise software that respects Islamic principles, but most solutions treat Sharia-compliance as an afterthought—bolted on rather than built in.

**Our Solution**: We're building an open-source platform with Sharia-compliance at its core. Starting with ERP foundations, we'll expand to fintech and beyond, making trustworthy business systems accessible to any organization—regardless of size, region, or industry.

**What We Believe:**

- 🕌 **Sharia-compliance as a foundation** should be built into enterprise solutions from the ground up, not bolted on later
- 🔓 **Transparency and openness** in the code helps build trust in Sharia-compliant enterprise solutions
- 🌐 **Open source by default** - We believe in radical transparency unless it compromises security and/or privacy protection
- 🤖 **AI-assisted development, not vibe-coding** - We leverage AI tools systematically to enhance productivity and code quality, not as a substitute for thoughtful engineering
- 🤝 **Community collaboration** can accelerate the development of accessible and culturally sensitive business tools
- 💡 **Innovation** across enterprise domains (financial services, supply chain, HR, and more) should be driven by open standards and shared knowledge
- 🛡️ **Governance and security from day one** are essential for enterprise solutions - good governance and sound security practices must be architectural foundations, not afterthoughts
- 🎯 **Production ready from beta** - Every feature follows clear quality stages: Alpha (experimental, not production ready), Beta (production ready: secure, scalable, documented), Stable (battle-tested, proven in production)

🚀 Our mission is to democratize access to trustworthy, Sharia-compliant enterprise technology for organizations of all sizes, regardless of region or industry.

## 🗺️ Development Roadmap

This project is being developed with a **phased approach** to establish strong Sharia-compliance foundations and gradually expand enterprise capabilities:

### 📊 Phase 1: ERP Foundation

Building a solid enterprise foundation with ERP capabilities to support core business operations:

- 🕌 **Sharia Compliance Framework** - Core architecture for Sharia-compliant business logic
- 📋 **Accounting & Finance** - Sharia-compliant financial management and reporting
- 🔗 **Supply Chain Management** - Halal-compliant supply chain tracking and operations
- 👥 **HR & Payroll** - Sharia-compliant workforce management
- 📊 **Core ERP Modules** - Foundation for enterprise resource planning

### 🇮🇩 Phase 2: Indonesian Fintech Integration

Expand into fintech capabilities with Indonesian regulatory alignment:

- 🏦 **Indonesian Banking Authority (OJK)** - Sharia banking regulations compliance
- 📋 **National Sharia Board (DSN-MUI)** - Islamic finance guidelines integration
- 📚 **Indonesian fintech standards** and best practices
- 💳 **Fintech domain implementation** (payments, lending, banking services)

### 🌐 Phase 3: Multi-Domain Enterprise Solutions

Extend to support additional enterprise solutions and domains:

- 🏪 **Retail & E-commerce** - Sharia-compliant sales and inventory systems
- 🏭 **Manufacturing** - Production planning and management
- 🎯 **Other enterprise domains** - Extending the framework to additional business solutions

### 🌍 Phase 4: Global Expansion

Extend the platform to support multiple jurisdictions and regions:

- 🕌 **International Islamic finance standards** - Accounting (AAOIFI) and prudential (IFSB) standards
- 🌏 **Multi-jurisdiction compliance** for various countries and regions
- 📖 **Regional variations** in Sharia interpretations and requirements
- ✈️ **Cross-border enterprise operations** support

### 💭 Why This Approach?

- 🏗️ **ERP as foundation** - Enterprise Resource Planning provides the core infrastructure for all business operations
- 🕌 **Sharia-compliance from day one** - Establishing robust compliance principles from the start
- 📈 **Scalable architecture** - Standards-based design enables extension to new domains and regions
- 🔄 **Reusable components** - ERP foundation supports fintech and other domains
- ⚖️ **Gradual expansion** reduces complexity while ensuring quality

## 🤝 Contributing

🔒 **Contributions are currently closed** until the project patterns and architecture are stable enough to accept external contributions. This ensures we maintain code quality and regulatory compliance as we build the foundation.

However, 🎉 **you are welcome to fork this repository!** Feel free to:

- 🍴 Create your own fork for your region or use case
- 🧪 Experiment with extensions and modifications
- 🏗️ Build upon this project for your specific needs
- 📤 Share your improvements with the community

✨ Once the core patterns are established and the project is mature enough, we will open the contribution process. We look forward to collaborating with the community in the future!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

🎯 **Guiding Principle:**
We choose technologies that keep you free. Your data stays yours, in open formats you can take anywhere. No vendor traps, no proprietary formats, no forced dependencies.

**What this means:**

- 📁 **Your data is portable** - Plain text and open formats you can read anywhere
- ☁️ **No forced dependencies** - Pick your own hosting, database, or infrastructure
- 📤 **Easy migration** - Export and move to alternatives anytime
- 🔐 **Community ownership** - You control your technology choices

We prefer open-source tools, but we'll use non-open-source software if it respects these principles.

💡 **Example:** We use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for documentation (not open-source), but all docs are plain markdown files. You can open them in any text editor—no lock-in, complete freedom.

📦 **Project Tooling:**

- ⚙️ Node.js & npm - Project management, development tools, and scripts
- 🎨 Prettier - Code formatting
- 🪝 Husky & lint-staged - Git hooks and automated checks
- ✅ Commitlint - Commit message validation

🚀 **Main Service:**
The tech stack for the main enterprise platform is currently being evaluated. Updates will be provided as architectural decisions are finalized. Technology selection will follow our open-source and vendor-neutrality principles.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

🔧 **Project Tooling & Infrastructure:**

- 📦 **Node.js**: 24.11.1 LTS (pinned via Volta)
- 📦 **npm**: 11.6.3 (pinned via Volta)
- ⚡ **Volta**: [Install Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) for automatic Node.js/npm version management

> 💡 **Note:** Node.js is used for project tooling, infrastructure, and development tools. The tech stack for the main enterprise platform is currently being decided and may be implemented in a different technology.

### 📥 Installation

### 🏗️ Monorepo Architecture

This project uses **Nx** to manage applications and libraries:

- **`apps/`** - Deployable applications (e.g., `api-gateway`, `admin-dashboard`)
- **`libs/`** - Reusable libraries with language prefixes (`ts-*`, future: `java-*`, `py-*`)
- **`apps-labs/`** - Experimental apps and POCs (framework evaluation, language exploration)

**Quick Commands**:

```bash
nx dev [app-name]       # Start development server
nx build [app-name]     # Build specific project
nx affected:build       # Build only affected projects
nx graph                # Visualize dependencies
```
