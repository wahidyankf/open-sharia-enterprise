# Project Conventions

Project-level documentation and planning organization standards.

## Purpose

These conventions define **HOW project planning and management documents should be organized**, covering the structure, naming, and lifecycle of planning documents in the `plans/` folder.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Project planning document organization
- Plans folder structure and workflow
- Planning document naming standards
- Project-level documentation standards

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Code/repository documentation (that's content/)
- Development workflow practices (that's development/)
- General file naming (that's meta/)

## Conventions

- [Plans Organization](./ex-ru-co-pr__plans-organization.md) - Standards for organizing project planning documents in plans/ folder including structure, naming, and workflow

## Related Documentation

- [Conventions Index](../README.md) - All documentation conventions
- [File Naming Convention](../meta/ex-ru-co-me__file-naming.md) - General file naming patterns
- [Workflows Index](../../workflows/README.md) - Orchestrated processes
- [Repository Architecture](../../ex-ru__repository-governance-architecture.md) - Six-layer governance model

## Principles Implemented/Respected

This set of conventions implements/respects the following core principles:

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../principles/software-engineering/ex-ru-pr-se__explicit-over-implicit.md)**: Plans Organization Convention defines explicit folder structure (ideas.md, backlog/, in-progress/, done/) and naming patterns (YYYY-MM-DD\_\_identifier) making project lifecycle transparent.

- **[No Time Estimates](../../principles/content/ex-ru-pr-co__no-time-estimates.md)**: Project planning focuses on outcomes and completion criteria rather than duration estimates, respecting different working paces and avoiding false precision.

- **[Progressive Disclosure](../../principles/content/ex-ru-pr-co__progressive-disclosure.md)**: Plans folder structure organizes work by lifecycle stage (backlog → in-progress → done), allowing progressive disclosure of project details.
