🚀 Phase 1 Begins: Development Infrastructure First

First week of Phase 1. Before building Organic Lever, we're building the foundation to build it right.

**This Week + Next: Development Infrastructure Focus**

Priority: Reproducible, productive, safe development environments.

**Week 0013 Progress:**
• Staging environment configuration + K8s deployment placeholders
• Renamed infra/local → infra/dev for clarity
• Docker permission fixes (developer experience)
• Spring Boot deprecation cleanup
• npm security vulnerability resolution

**Focus Areas (Weeks 13-14):**
• Devbox setup and configuration
• Development environment reproducibility
• Tooling for developer productivity
• Architecture patterns and safety guardrails

Phase 1 Goal: Organic Lever (productivity tracker)
Target: Local client → Web → Android → iOS
Timeline: 12-16 weeks, Insha Allah

Infrastructure first, features second. Quality over speed. No shortcuts.
