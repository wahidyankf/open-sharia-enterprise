OPEN SHARIA ENTERPRISE

Week 7, Phase 0 Update

---

🏗️ **Moving to Cloud-First Development**

This past week, I focused on making open-sharia-enterprise development truly portable and ready to run anywhere, anytime.

**What I Did:**

☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure Migration**

Successfully migrated my development environment to a DigitalOcean droplet and implemented critical security hardening. Used Terraform and Ansible to make the setup portable. Now the project can run 24/7 in the cloud, not just on my laptop.

🤖 **Improved AI Tooling**

Updated the repository to use "skills" with Claude Code - a way to break down complex tasks into reusable pieces. It's not perfect yet, but it's a start toward more efficient automation.

🔧 **Exploring Alternatives**

Started planning to adopt OpenCode alongside Claude Code, experimenting with z.ai's GLM model. Not going smoothly yet, but that's expected for now. Hoping the next week brings better results.

**What's Next:**

Week 8: Add OpenCode as a secondary tool to expand capabilities.

Week 9: Wrap up AI development tooling fundamentals and design initial architecture for feature development.

Week 10: Start building actual use cases (hard deadline - AI tools are means to an end, not the end itself).
