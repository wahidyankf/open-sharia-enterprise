Week: 0005
Phase: 0

Following last week's Phase 0 progress update, I continued building foundation—new automation tools, repository cleanup, and navigation system overhaul.

📍 Starting Point (December 15):

- Demo applications and libraries present
- 30 AI agents
- 3-layer navigation structure

✅ Current State (December 21):

- 🗑️ Repository cleanup complete (removed demo-ts-fe, ts-demo-libs)
- 🤖 37 AI agents (7 new additions for navigation automation, structural validation, fact-checking, and social media content)
- ⚙️ Built Go-based CLI tool (ayokoding-cli for automated navigation generation)
- 🧭 Regenerated navigation across hundreds of content files
- 📄 Enhanced CLAUDE.md with comprehensive agent documentation
- 📚 Documentation expansion: Established core-principles (6 foundational values), four-layer architecture model (principles → conventions/development → agents), implementation workflow standards, and factual verification methodology
- 🎓 AyoKoding educational content: Launched three programming languages (Elixir, Kotlin, Rust). Added Gobuster security tutorials and reference documentation for Golang/Java/Python
- 🏗️ Evaluation App Specifications: Initiate systematic framework for evaluating programming languages/frameworks via practical implementations (IAM system featuring REST + GraphQL APIs, PostgreSQL, FSM, CIA security principles). Pipeline: Java/Spring Boot, Elixir/Phoenix, Go/stdlib

💭 Reflection:

- Codebase is cleaner. Automation is more robust. Foundation work continues in Phase 0.

📅 Coming Next Week:

- Begin building evaluation applications to test programming language and framework ergonomics and experience
- Continue Phase 0 infrastructure development
