Building in the Open: Phase 0 Progress on Open Sharia Enterprise

After 440+ commits of methodical foundation work, I'm sharing an update on Open Sharia Enterprise Platform—an open-source, Sharia-compliant enterprise solution I'm building in the open outside office hours.

🏗️ The Unconventional Approach

Most projects rush to features. I'm trying to do the opposite. Phase 0 focuses on building solid foundations: documentation frameworks, development conventions, AI-assisted quality workflows, and security planning—all before writing production code.

Why? Because foundations matter. I'm building for decades, not months.

🤖 AI as a Tool, Not Magic

You've seen the hype: "AI builds Minecraft in 2 hours!" That's not what I'm doing here.

I've built 20+ specialized AI agents following a maker-checker-fixer pattern. When I need documentation, a maker agent drafts it. A checker agent validates and generates an audit report. I review that report and decide what to apply. A fixer agent then applies only the approved changes.

The agents catch formatting issues, broken links, and accessibility problems. I make decisions about architecture, tone, and strategy. It's AI-assisted development with human oversight and appropriate guardrails—not "vibe-coding" where you hope the AI got it right.

This is how AI should work in serious projects: augmenting human expertise, not replacing judgment.

📍 Where I Actually Am

Let's be clear: The project is in early Phase 0, pre-alpha. There's no product to download. What I have is:

• Documentation framework taking shape (Diátaxis + 20+ conventions)
• Nx monorepo architecture established
• 20+ specialized AI agents for quality automation
• Two websites launched (oseplatform.com + ayokoding.com)
• Security infrastructure planned from day one

This isn't sexy, but it's sustainable progress.

📢 Following Along

I'm, insha Allah, committing to transparency in how I build this:

📅 Weekly updates here on LinkedIn - sharing learnings, decisions, and small milestones as they happen

📝 Monthly comprehensive reports - detailed progress updates every 2nd Sunday on <https://www.oseplatform.com/>

📚 Learning in public - technical insights and research shared on <https://www.ayokoding.com/> and <https://github.com/wahidyankf/open-sharia-enterprise/tree/main/docs>

🔓 Complete transparency - every line of code that doesn't affect the security of this project will be visible on GitHub as much as possible

Open source creates trust. Building in public enables collaboration. This approach may seem slow, but I'm prioritizing quality over speed.

There's no timeline. We'll get there when we get there. Thinking thoughtfully and strategically always pays off. Could you rush now, pay later? Build right, benefit forever.
