🧪 Building the Testing Foundation: E2E Suite + Infrastructure Hardening

Week 2 of Phase 1. Still laying the foundation — but this week we went wider and deeper.

**Week 0014 Progress:**

- OrganicLever: 6 app placeholders scaffolded in Nx monorepo — landing page (organiclever.com, Next.js 14), Spring Boot backend, Flutter app, and all 3 E2E test suites — all Vercel-ready
- Rhino-CLI `doctor` command: checks that all required dev tools (git, volta, node, npm, java, maven, golang) are installed with correct versions
- OSEPlatform web: added Mermaid diagrams to update posts and an accessible visual roadmap
- Repository housekeeping: standardized app naming, enforced no-hardcoded-counts convention in docs

**Focus Areas (Weeks 13-14):**

- Devbox setup and configuration
- Development environment reproducibility
- Tooling for developer productivity
- Architecture patterns and safety guardrails
