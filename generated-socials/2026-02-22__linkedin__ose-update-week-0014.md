🧪 Building the Testing Foundation: E2E Suite + Infrastructure Hardening

Week 2 of Phase 1. Still laying the foundation — but this week we went wider and deeper.

**Week 0014 Progress:**

- OrganicLever: 6 app placeholders in Nx monorepo (organiclever-web, organiclever-web-e2e, organiclever-be, organiclever-be-e2e, organiclever-app, organiclever-app-web-e2e)
- organiclever-web: OrganicLever landing page (organiclever.com, Next.js 14) integrated into Nx monorepo with Vercel deployment
- Rhino-CLI doctor command: verifies all required dev tools (git, volta, node, npm, java, maven, golang) are installed with correct versions — added git check, refactored parser architecture
- OSEPlatform web: added Mermaid diagrams to update posts + accessible roadmap
- App naming standardized: oseplatform-web, organiclever (removed hyphens)
- New convention: dynamic-collection-references (no hardcoded counts in docs)

**Focus Areas (Weeks 13-14):**

- Devbox setup and configuration
- Development environment reproducibility
- Tooling for developer productivity
- Architecture patterns and safety guardrails
