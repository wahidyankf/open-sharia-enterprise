OPEN SHARIA ENTERPRISE

Week 8, Phase 0 Update

---

🏗️ **From Exploration to Implementation: Governance & AI Systems Operational**

Last week was about experimenting with alternatives. This week, those experiments transformed into production-ready systems.

**What Changed (Week 8 vs Week 7):**

📐 **6-Layer Governance Architecture: NEW**

Week 7: Basic AI tooling exploration.
Week 8: Established comprehensive governance hierarchy: Vision → Principles → Conventions → Development → AI Agents → Workflows. Every rule traces back to foundational values, preventing contradictions and governance drift.

🤖 **45 Specialized AI Agents: NEW**

Week 7: 20+ agents in development.
Week 8: Completed Agent Simplification Plan with scope-prefixed naming (`docs-*`, `apps-ayokoding-web-*`, `apps-ose-platform-web-*`, `readme-*`, `plan-*`). All 45 agents follow consistent patterns with maker-checker-fixer quality workflow.

📦 **23 Skills Infrastructure: NEW**

Week 7: None.
Week 8: Implemented Skills as delivery infrastructure - 23 knowledge packages that agents load on-demand. Six domains covered: documentation, workflow/patterns, project planning, application development, AI agent development, README writing.

📚 **Content Quality Parity: ENHANCED**

Week 7: Individual tutorial improvements.
Week 8: Enhanced 7 programming languages (Golang, Java, Python, Kotlin, Rust, Elixir, Clojure) to quality parity standards - every language now has the same high bar (40+ annotations per example, "Why It Matters" sections).

🔒 **OpenCode: From Experiment to Production**

Week 7: Exploring OpenCode + GLM model (experiments, not smooth).
Week 8: Full implementation ready - GLM-4.7 as primary, 4 Z.AI MCP servers, Perplexity MCP for web search, dual-format for all 45 agents. Complete migration planned inshaAllah within next 4 weeks.

**What's Next:**

Next 4 weeks: Complete migration to OpenCode-only, establish first service skeletons (LMS, Middleware, IAM), solidify CI/CD.
