🏗️ **Governance & AI Systems: Foundations Complete**

This week marked a major milestone - our six-layer governance architecture is now operational with 45 specialized AI agents working together to ensure quality across the entire codebase.

**What I Did:**

📐 **6-Layer Governance Architecture**

Established a comprehensive governance hierarchy: Vision → Principles → Conventions → Development → AI Agents → Workflows. Every rule traces back to foundational values, preventing contradictions and governance drift. Skills exist as delivery infrastructure (23 knowledge packages) that agents load on-demand.

🤖 **45 Specialized AI Agents**

Completed the Agent Simplification Plan with scope-prefixed naming: `docs-*`, `apps-ayokoding-web-*`, `apps-ose-platform-web-*`, `readme-*`, `plan-*`. All agents follow consistent patterns with the maker-checker-fixer quality workflow (maker creates draft → checker validates → human reviews → fixer applies changes with confidence levels).

📚 **Content Quality Standards**

By-example tutorials now require 40+ annotations per code example, plus "Why It Matters" sections connecting to real-world scenarios. Enhanced 7 programming languages (Golang, Java, Python, Kotlin, Rust, Elixir, Clojure) to meet quality parity standards - every language now has the same high bar.

🔒 **OpenCode: Vendor Independence Strategy**

Completed full migration preparation after Anthropic's decision to block third-party Claude Code access. Implementation includes:

- GLM-4.7 model as primary choice
- 4 Z.AI MCP servers for image analysis
- Perplexity MCP server for web search
- Dual-format maintenance (all 45 agents work on both platforms)
- Full migration planned inshaAllah within next 4 weeks

This ensures we're not locked into any single vendor - strategic direction is clear: open-source foundations, open-source tools, open-source future.

**What's Next:**

Next 4 weeks: Complete migration to OpenCode-only and phase out Claude Code, establish first service skeletons (LMS, Middleware, IAM), and solidify CI/CD tooling.

Weeks 5-8: Continue Phase 0 foundational research with mature governance architecture, robust agent systems, and established content quality standards.
