OPEN SHARIA ENTERPRISE
Week 0010, Phase 0 Update

---

🏗️ **Infrastructure Over Features: Building the Foundation**

Week 10 focused on quality infrastructure. Two main systems launched to accelerate future development.

---

🏛️ **Authoritative Coding Standards Infrastructure: COMPLETED**

Week 9: No formal standards infrastructure, 45 agents, 21 skills
Week 10: 343 files (345k lines) established as authoritative + 50 agents + 27 skills

Established docs/explanation/software/ as authoritative source for coding decisions—architecture (C4, DDD), practices (TDD, BDD), languages (5), frameworks (3). Extended governance with 8-category validation. Created 5 skills + 5 developer agents.

**Impact**: Complete ecosystem—343k lines of standards + skills + agents. AI agents cite docs vs hallucinating.

⚡ **RHINO CLI: Ready Repository Automation**

Week 9: Bash scripts (3-5 seconds, fragile)
Week 10: Go CLI with 25-60x performance improvement (49-121ms, robust)

Shipped rhino-cli v0.4—Go automation replacing bash. Four commands: validate-claude (49ms, 11 rules), sync-agents (121ms), validate-sync, validate-links. Pre-commit integrated.

**Impact**: 3-5s → <150ms. Instant git hooks. Auto-validation on every commit.

---

**What This Enables:**

Infrastructure compounds. Standards + validation = quality at scale. AI agents reference 345k verified patterns. Pre-commit catches issues in milliseconds vs CI minutes. Foundation for rapid development.

---

**What's Next:**

Complete framework docs, expand architecture patterns, enhance practices, validate performance.
