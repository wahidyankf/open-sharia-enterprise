# Common Software Development Workflow

This Skill provides universal development workflow guidance shared across all language-specific developer agents in the Open Sharia Enterprise platform.

## Purpose

Use this Skill when:

- Developing applications in any programming language
- Working within the Nx monorepo structure
- Following platform git workflow standards
- Understanding tool usage patterns for development
- Leveraging platform automation

## Tool Usage for Developers

**Standard Developer Tools**: read, write, edit, glob, grep, bash

**Tool Purposes**:

- **read**: Load source files and documentation for analysis
- **write**: Create new source files and test files
- **edit**: Modify existing code files
- **glob**: Discover files matching patterns
- **grep**: Search code patterns across files
- **bash**: Execute language tooling, run tests, git operations

**Tool Selection Guidance**:

- Use **read** for understanding existing code and documentation
- Use **write** for creating new files from scratch
- Use **edit** for modifying existing files (preferred over write for changes)
- Use **glob** for file discovery (NOT bash find)
- Use **grep** for content search (NOT bash grep)
- Use **bash** for running compilers, test runners, build tools, git commands

## Nx Monorepo Integration

### Repository Structure

This platform uses **Nx** for monorepo management with clear separation of concerns:

**Apps** (`apps/[app-name]`):

- Deployable applications
- Import libraries but never export
- Each independently deployable
- Never import other apps

**Libraries** (`libs/[lib-name]`):

- Reusable code modules
- Flat structure (no nesting)
- Can import other libraries (no circular dependencies)
- Naming convention: `[language]-[name]` (e.g., `ts-utils`, `java-common`)

### Common Nx Commands

**Development**:

```bash
nx dev [project-name]       # Start development server
nx serve [project-name]     # Alternative to dev
```

**Building**:

```bash
nx build [project-name]     # Build specific project
nx affected:build          # Build only affected projects
```

**Testing**:

```bash
nx test [project-name]      # Test specific project
nx affected:test           # Test only affected projects
nx test:quick              # Quick test suite (pre-push)
```

**Analysis**:

```bash
nx graph                   # Visualize dependencies
nx affected:graph          # Show affected dependency graph
```

**Affected Commands Philosophy**:

- After making changes, use `nx affected:*` commands
- Only builds/tests projects impacted by your changes
- Efficient in large monorepo (don't rebuild everything)

### Monorepo Best Practices

1. **Keep libraries focused**: Each library should have single responsibility
2. **Avoid circular dependencies**: Libraries form directed acyclic graph (DAG)
3. **Use affected commands**: Leverage Nx's smart rebuilding
4. **Apps never depend on apps**: Only libraries are shared
5. **Test at library level**: Unit test libraries, integration test apps

## Git Workflow

### Trunk Based Development

**Core Principle**: All development happens on `main` branch

**Branch Strategy**:

- **Default branch**: `main` (all development work)
- **Environment branches**: `prod-*` (deployment only, never commit directly)
- **No feature branches**: Commit small changes frequently to main
- **No long-lived branches**: Keep changes integrated

**Why Trunk Based Development?**

- Reduces merge conflicts (no long-lived branches)
- Encourages small, incremental changes
- Faster feedback loop
- Simplifies deployment pipeline

### Conventional Commits Format

**Pattern**: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

**Required Format**:

- **type**: Category of change (see types below)
- **scope**: Optional but recommended (component/module affected)
- **description**: Imperative mood ("add" not "added"), no period at end

**Commit Types**:

- **feat**: New feature or capability
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes only
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- **refactor**: Code restructuring (no feature change, no bug fix)
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Build process, tooling, dependencies
- **ci**: CI/CD pipeline changes
- **revert**: Reverting previous commit

**Examples**:

```bash
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support
fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(utils): simplify date formatting logic
test(auth): add integration tests for login flow
```

**Split Commits by Domain**:

- Different types → separate commits
- Different scopes → separate commits
- Different concerns → separate commits

**Example** (wrong):

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add login + fix(api): fix bug + docs: update readme"
```

**Example** (correct):

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation instructions"
```

### Git Discipline

**CRITICAL**: Never stage or commit unless explicitly instructed by user

**Default Behavior**:

- Do NOT run `git add` automatically
- Do NOT run `git commit` automatically
- User must explicitly request commits

**Commit Permission**:

- One-time only (not continuous)
- User says "commit these changes" → you commit once
- User does NOT say "commit everything I ask you to do" → don't assume

**Why This Matters**:

- User controls git history
- Prevents unwanted commits
- User decides commit boundaries
- Respects user's workflow preferences

## Pre-commit Automation

### Automated Quality Gates

When code files are modified, **Husky + lint-staged** automatically run:

**Pre-commit Hooks**:

1. **Format with Prettier**: Automatically formats staged files
2. **Lint markdown**: Validates markdown files with markdownlint
3. **Validate links**: Checks markdown links aren't broken
4. **Run affected tests**: Executes `test:quick` for changed projects
5. **Auto-stage changes**: Automatically stages formatting fixes

**Commit-msg Hook**:

- **Validate commit format**: Ensures Conventional Commits compliance
- **Blocks invalid commits**: Prevents commit if format wrong

**Pre-push Hook**:

- **Run affected tests**: Executes full test suite for affected projects
- **Markdown linting**: Final markdown quality check

### Trust the Automation

**Philosophy**: Focus on code quality, let automation handle style

**What This Means**:

- Don't manually format code (Prettier handles it)
- Don't worry about markdown formatting (automated)
- Don't manually check links (automation validates)
- Trust that tests will run before push

**If Pre-commit Hook Fails**:

1. Read the error message carefully
2. Fix the reported issue
3. Re-stage files if needed
4. Commit again (creates NEW commit, don't amend unless asked)

**Common Failures**:

- **Markdown linting**: Run `npm run lint:md:fix` to auto-fix
- **Test failures**: Fix the failing test, re-commit
- **Link validation**: Fix broken links, re-commit
- **Commit message format**: Rewrite commit message following Conventional Commits

## Development Workflow Pattern

### Standard 6-Step Workflow

All language developers follow this pattern:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Understand functional and technical requirements
2. **Design**: Apply appropriate patterns and platform architecture
3. **Implementation**: Write clean, tested, documented code
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and e2e tests
5. **Code Review**: Self-review against coding standards
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs and code comments

### Implementation Philosophy

**Make it work → Make it right → Make it fast**

1. **Make it work**: Get basic functionality working (passing tests)
2. **Make it right**: Refactor for clarity, follow standards, eliminate duplication
3. **Make it fast**: Optimize performance where needed (measure first)

**Avoid**:

- Premature optimization (fast before right)
- Over-engineering (complex before simple)
- Skipping tests (work without validation)

## Reference Documentation Patterns

### Standard Project Documentation

**All language developers reference**:

- **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)**: Primary guidance for all agents
- **[Monorepo Structure](../../docs/reference/re__monorepo-structure.md)**: Nx workspace organization
- **[Commit Messages Convention](../../governance/development/workflow/commit-messages.md)**: Conventional Commits detailed guide
- **[Code Quality Convention](../../governance/development/quality/code.md)**: Git hooks and automation
- **[Trunk Based Development](../../governance/development/workflow/trunk-based-development.md)**: Git workflow philosophy

### Language-Specific Documentation

Each language has authoritative coding standards in:

```
docs/explanation/software/stack-lang/[language]/README.md
```

**Examples**:

- TypeScript: `docs/explanation/software/stack-lang/typescript/README.md`
- Java: `docs/explanation/software/stack-lang/java/README.md`
- Python: `docs/explanation/software/stack-lang/python/README.md`
- Elixir: `docs/explanation/software/stack-lang/elixir/README.md`
- Go: `docs/explanation/software/stack-lang/golang/README.md`

**Each language README covers**:

1. Language idioms and patterns
2. Best practices for clean code
3. Anti-patterns to avoid
4. Framework-specific guidance
5. Testing strategies
