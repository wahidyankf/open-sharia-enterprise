# Explanation

**Understanding-oriented documentation** that provides background, context, and conceptual knowledge about the open-sharia-enterprise project.

## What is Explanation Documentation?

Per the [Diátaxis framework](./rules/conventions/meta/ex-ru-co-me__diataxis-framework.md), Explanation documentation:

- **Deepens understanding** of concepts, design decisions, and systems
- **Answers "why?"** questions and provides context
- **Clarifies background** and alternative approaches
- **Discusses trade-offs** and decision rationale

This is distinct from:

- **Tutorials** (learning by doing)
- **How-to Guides** (solving specific problems)
- **Reference** (technical specifications)

## Documentation Scope

This directory contains conceptual documentation across multiple areas:

- **Repository Governance** - How we organize, validate, and enforce standards
- **Project Architecture** - System design and technical decisions
- **Domain Concepts** - Shariah-compliant enterprise principles and Islamic business foundations
- **Technical Background** - Technologies, patterns, and frameworks used in the project

## 🏛️ Repository Governance

The repository follows a **six-layer governance architecture** (Vision → Principles → Conventions → Development → Agents → Workflows) where each layer builds on the foundation above.

**See [Rules](./rules/README.md)** for governance overview with architecture diagram, layer descriptions, and decision trees.

**See [Repository Governance Architecture](./rules/ex-ru__repository-governance-architecture.md)** for comprehensive explanation with traceability examples, usage guidance, and verification methods.
