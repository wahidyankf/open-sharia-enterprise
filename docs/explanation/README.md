# Explanation

Conceptual documentation for the open-sharia-enterprise project. These documents provide context, deep dives, and understanding of how systems work and why design decisions were made.

## 🎯 Understanding Conventions vs Development

**Conventions** and **Development** are both standards, but serve different purposes:

- **[Conventions](./conventions/README.md)** - How we **write and structure documentation**
  - Documentation format, style, and organization
  - Markdown writing standards
  - File naming, linking, and content quality
  - Applies to: docs/, Hugo content, plans/, README files

- **[Development](./development/README.md)** - How we **develop software and systems**
  - Software development practices and methodologies
  - Build processes, tooling, and workflows
  - Testing, deployment, and code management
  - Applies to: source code, Hugo themes/layouts, build systems, AI agents
