# Finite State Machines in Python

**Quick Reference**: [Overview](#overview) | [State Pattern](#state-pattern) | [transitions Library](#transitions-library) | [Event-Driven FSM](#event-driven-fsm) | [Guards and Conditions](#guards-and-conditions) | [Callbacks and Hooks](#callbacks-and-hooks) | [Nested State Machines](#nested-state-machines) | [Financial Domain FSMs](#financial-domain-fsms) | [Best Practices](#fsm-best-practices) | [References](#references)

## Overview

Finite State Machines (FSM) model systems that exist in one state at a time and transition between states based on events. For OSE Platform financial applications, FSMs manage loan lifecycles, campaign statuses, and payment workflows with clear state transitions and validation rules.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Active: approve()
    Active --> Paused: pause()
    Paused --> Active: resume()
    Active --> Completed: complete()
    Active --> Cancelled: cancel()
    Draft --> Cancelled: cancel()
    Completed --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]

    note right of Active
        Campaign actively
        accepting donations
    end note
```

### FSM Benefits

**Explicit States**: Clear enumeration of all possible states.

**Controlled Transitions**: Only valid state transitions allowed.

**Business Logic Clarity**: State-specific behavior isolated.

**Validation**: Guards ensure preconditions before transitions.

**Audit Trail**: State changes logged automatically.

## State Pattern

Manual FSM implementation using state pattern.

### QardHasan Loan State Transitions

```mermaid
%% Color Palette: Blue #0173B2, Orange #DE8F05, Teal #029E73, Purple #CC78BC
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DRAFT: Create loan

    DRAFT --> SUBMITTED: submit()
    DRAFT --> CANCELLED: cancel()

    SUBMITTED --> APPROVED: approve()
    SUBMITTED --> CANCELLED: cancel()

    APPROVED --> ACTIVE: disburse()
    APPROVED --> CANCELLED: cancel()

    ACTIVE --> FULLY_REPAID: record_payment()<br/>(full repayment)
    ACTIVE --> DEFAULTED: mark_defaulted()

    FULLY_REPAID --> [*]
    DEFAULTED --> [*]
    CANCELLED --> [*]

    note right of DRAFT
        Initial state
        Loan being prepared
    end note

    note right of ACTIVE
        Loan disbursed
        Accepting repayments
    end note
```

**Key States**:

- DRAFT: Loan being prepared
- SUBMITTED: Awaiting approval
- APPROVED: Approved, awaiting disbursement
- ACTIVE: Funds disbursed, accepting repayments
- FULLY_REPAID: All payments complete (terminal)
- DEFAULTED: Borrower defaulted (terminal)
- CANCELLED: Loan cancelled (terminal)

### Basic State Pattern

```python
# GOOD: State pattern implementation

        """Already cancelled."""
        raise ValueError("Loan already cancelled")
```

**Why this matters**: State pattern encapsulates state-specific behavior. Each state class handles transitions. Invalid transitions raise errors. Type-safe and explicit.

### Using State Pattern

```python
# GOOD: Using state pattern
from decimal import Decimal


# Create loan in draft state
loan = QardHasanLoan(
    id="QL-2025-001",
    borrower_id="BORROWER-123",
    principal=Decimal("50000"),
    repaid=Decimal("0"),
    status=LoanStatus.DRAFT,
    state=DraftState(),
)

# Submit for approval
loan.submit()
assert loan.status == LoanStatus.SUBMITTED

# Approve loan
loan.approve()
assert loan.status == LoanStatus.APPROVED

# Disburse funds
loan.disburse()
assert loan.status == LoanStatus.ACTIVE

# Record repayments
loan.record_payment(Decimal("20000"))
assert loan.repaid == Decimal("20000")

loan.record_payment(Decimal("30000"))
assert loan.status == LoanStatus.FULLY_REPAID


# Invalid transitions raise errors
try:
    loan.record_payment(Decimal("100"))  # Cannot pay fully repaid loan
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # "Loan already fully repaid"
```

**Why this matters**: State pattern prevents invalid operations. Clear error messages. Type-safe transitions. Business rules encoded in states.

## transitions Library

transitions library provides declarative FSM with less boilerplate.

### Donation Campaign State Machine

```mermaid
%% Color Palette: Blue #0173B2, Orange #DE8F05, Teal #029E73, Purple #CC78BC
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> DRAFT

    DRAFT --> ACTIVE: activate()
    DRAFT --> CANCELLED: cancel()

    ACTIVE --> PAUSED: pause()
    ACTIVE --> COMPLETED: complete()
    ACTIVE --> CANCELLED: cancel()

    PAUSED --> ACTIVE: resume()
    PAUSED --> CANCELLED: cancel()

    COMPLETED --> [*]
    CANCELLED --> [*]
```

### Installing transitions

```bash
pip install transitions
```

### Basic transitions FSM

```python
# GOOD: transitions library FSM
from transitions import Machine
from enum import Enum
from decimal import Decimal
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List


class CampaignStatus(str, Enum):
    """Campaign status enumeration."""

    DRAFT = "draft"
    ACTIVE = "active"
    PAUSED = "paused"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    CANCELLED = "cancelled"


@dataclass
class DonationCampaign:
    """Donation campaign with FSM."""

    id: str
    name: str
    target_amount: Decimal
    current_amount: Decimal = Decimal("0")
    donor_count: int = 0
    status: str = CampaignStatus.DRAFT.value
    state_history: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)


# Define state machine
states = [
    CampaignStatus.DRAFT.value,
    CampaignStatus.ACTIVE.value,
    CampaignStatus.PAUSED.value,
    CampaignStatus.COMPLETED.value,
    CampaignStatus.CANCELLED.value,
]

transitions_config = [
    {
        "trigger": "activate",
        "source": CampaignStatus.DRAFT.value,
        "dest": CampaignStatus.ACTIVE.value,
    },
    {
        "trigger": "pause",
        "source": CampaignStatus.ACTIVE.value,
        "dest": CampaignStatus.PAUSED.value,
    },
    {
        "trigger": "resume",
        "source": CampaignStatus.PAUSED.value,
        "dest": CampaignStatus.ACTIVE.value,
    },
    {
        "trigger": "complete",
        "source": CampaignStatus.ACTIVE.value,
        "dest": CampaignStatus.COMPLETED.value,
    },
    {
        "trigger": "cancel",
        "source": [CampaignStatus.DRAFT.value, CampaignStatus.ACTIVE.value],
        "dest": CampaignStatus.CANCELLED.value,
    },
]

# Create campaign with FSM
campaign = DonationCampaign(
    id="CAMP-001",
    name="Ramadan Relief",
    target_amount=Decimal("500000"),
)

machine = Machine(
    model=campaign,
    states=states,
    transitions=transitions_config,
    initial=CampaignStatus.DRAFT.value,
    auto_transitions=False,
)

# Use FSM
campaign.activate()
assert campaign.status == CampaignStatus.ACTIVE.value

campaign.pause()
assert campaign.status == CampaignStatus.PAUSED.value

campaign.resume()
assert campaign.status == CampaignStatus.ACTIVE.value
```

**Why this matters**: transitions library reduces boilerplate. Declarative configuration. Auto-validates transitions. Less code to maintain.

## Event-Driven FSM

FSMs respond to events with callbacks.

### FSM Callback Execution Order

```mermaid
%% Color Palette: Blue #0173B2, Orange #DE8F05, Teal #029E73, Purple #CC78BC
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Trigger (activate)
    participant FSM as State Machine
    participant From as DRAFT State
    participant To as ACTIVE State

    T->>FSM: trigger: activate()
    activate FSM

    FSM->>FSM: before_transition()
    FSM->>From: on_exit_draft()
    From->>From: Cleanup draft state

    FSM->>FSM: State change: DRAFT → ACTIVE

    FSM->>To: on_enter_active()
    To->>To: Initialize active state
    FSM->>FSM: after_transition()

    FSM-->>T: Transition complete
    deactivate FSM
```

**Callback Execution Order**:

1. `before_transition()` - Before state change
2. `on_exit_<source>()` - Exiting source state
3. **State change occurs**
4. `on_enter_<dest>()` - Entering destination state
5. `after_transition()` - After state change

### FSM with Callbacks

```python
# GOOD: FSM with before/after callbacks
from transitions import Machine
from decimal import Decimal
from datetime import datetime
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import List, Dict


@dataclass
class StateChange:
    """State change event."""

    from_state: str
    to_state: str
    trigger: str
    timestamp: datetime


@dataclass
class AuditedCampaign:
    """Campaign with audit trail."""

    id: str
    name: str
    target_amount: Decimal
    current_amount: Decimal = Decimal("0")
    status: str = "draft"
    state_changes: List[StateChange] = field(default_factory=list)

    def on_enter_active(self) -> None:
        """Callback when entering active state."""
        print(f"Campaign {self.name} is now active!")
        self._send_activation_notification()

    def on_exit_active(self) -> None:
        """Callback when exiting active state."""
        print(f"Campaign {self.name} is no longer active")

    def on_enter_completed(self) -> None:
        """Callback when entering completed state."""
        print(f"Campaign {self.name} completed!")
        self._generate_completion_report()

    def before_transition(self, event_data) -> None:
        """Callback before any transition."""
        print(f"Transitioning: {event_data.transition.source} -> {event_data.transition.dest}")

    def after_transition(self, event_data) -> None:
        """Callback after any transition."""
        # Record state change
        change = StateChange(
            from_state=event_data.transition.source,
            to_state=event_data.transition.dest,
            trigger=event_data.event.name,
            timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
        )
        self.state_changes.append(change)

    def _send_activation_notification(self) -> None:
        """Send notification to donors (stub)."""
        pass

    def _generate_completion_report(self) -> None:
        """Generate completion report (stub)."""
        pass


# Create FSM with callbacks
states = ["draft", "active", "paused", "completed", "cancelled"]

transitions_config = [
    {"trigger": "activate", "source": "draft", "dest": "active"},
    {"trigger": "pause", "source": "active", "dest": "paused"},
    {"trigger": "resume", "source": "paused", "dest": "active"},
    {"trigger": "complete", "source": "active", "dest": "completed"},
    {"trigger": "cancel", "source": ["draft", "active"], "dest": "cancelled"},
]

campaign = AuditedCampaign(
    id="CAMP-002",
    name="Orphan Support",
    target_amount=Decimal("250000"),
)

machine = Machine(
    model=campaign,
    states=states,
    transitions=transitions_config,
    initial="draft",
    auto_transitions=False,
    before_state_change="before_transition",
    after_state_change="after_transition",
)

# Trigger transitions (callbacks fire automatically)
campaign.activate()
# Output: "Transitioning: draft -> active"
# Output: "Campaign Orphan Support is now active!"

campaign.pause()
# Output: "Campaign Orphan Support is no longer active"
# Output: "Transitioning: active -> paused"

# Audit trail maintained
print(f"State changes: {len(campaign.state_changes)}")  # 2
```

**Why this matters**: Callbacks enable side effects. Audit trails automatic. Notification hooks. Clean separation of concerns.

## Guards and Conditions

Guards prevent invalid transitions based on business rules.

### Guard Evaluation Flow

```mermaid
%% Color Palette: Blue #0173B2, Orange #DE8F05, Teal #029E73, Purple #CC78BC
graph TD
    A["Trigger Event<br/>(activate)"]:::blue --> B{"Guard Function<br/>can_activate()"}:::orange

    B -->|"Returns True"| C["✅ Transition Allowed"]:::teal
    B -->|"Returns False"| D["❌ Transition Blocked"]:::purple

    C --> E["Execute Callbacks"]:::teal
    E --> F["Change State"]:::teal
    F --> G["ACTIVE State"]:::teal

    D --> H["Raise MachineError"]:::purple
    H --> I["State Unchanged<br/>(remains DRAFT)"]:::purple

    Note1["Guards check:<br/>- Business rules<br/>- Data validation<br/>- Preconditions"]

    classDef blue fill:#0173B2,stroke:#000,color:#fff
    classDef orange fill:#DE8F05,stroke:#000,color:#000
    classDef teal fill:#029E73,stroke:#000,color:#fff
    classDef purple fill:#CC78BC,stroke:#000,color:#000
```

**Guard Function Rules**:

- Return `True` to allow transition
- Return `False` to block transition
- Evaluated before state change
- Can access current state and model data

### Conditional Transitions

```python
# GOOD: Conditional transitions with guards
from transitions import Machine
from decimal import Decimal
from datetime import datetime, date
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class GuardedCampaign:
    """Campaign with guarded transitions."""

    id: str
    name: str
    target_amount: Decimal
    current_amount: Decimal = Decimal("0")
    start_date: date = field(default_factory=date.today)
    end_date: Optional[date] = None
    status: str = "draft"

    def can_activate(self) -> bool:
        """Guard: Check if campaign can be activated."""

# Create FSM with guards
states = ["draft", "active", "paused", "completed", "cancelled"]

transitions_config = [
    {

]

campaign = GuardedCampaign(
    id="CAMP-003",
    name="Water Wells",
    target_amount=Decimal("100000"),
    start_date=date(2025, 1, 15),
    end_date=date(2025, 12, 31),
)

machine = Machine(
    model=campaign,
    states=states,
    transitions=transitions_config,
    initial="draft",
    auto_transitions=False,
)

# Valid transition (guard passes)
campaign.activate()
assert campaign.status == "active"

# Invalid transition (guard fails - target not reached)
campaign.current_amount = Decimal("50000")  # Only 50% of target
campaign.complete()  # Transition BLOCKED by guard
assert campaign.status == "active"  # Still active

# Valid transition (guard passes - target reached)
campaign.current_amount = Decimal("100000")  # 100% of target
campaign.complete()
assert campaign.status == "completed"
```

**Why this matters**: Guards enforce business rules. Prevent invalid states. Declarative preconditions. Centralized validation logic.

## Callbacks and Hooks

Callbacks execute code during transitions.

### Callback Types and Timing

# Create FSM with detailed callbacks

# Trigger transition (all callbacks execute)
campaign.activate()
# Output:
# "Preparing to activate Medical Aid"
# "Activating Medical Aid"
# "Medical Aid activated successfully"
# "Sending activation email for Medical Aid"
```

**Why this matters**: Callbacks enable side effects. before/after hooks for validation and notifications. Declarative workflow orchestration.

## Nested State Machines

Hierarchical states with sub-state machines.

### Hierarchical States

```python
# GOOD: Nested state machines
from transitions.extensions import HierarchicalMachine
from decimal import Decimal
from dataclasses import dataclass


@dataclass
class PaymentWorkflow:
    """Payment workflow with nested states."""

    payment_id: str
    amount: Decimal
    status: str = "pending"


# Define hierarchical states
states = [
    {
        "name": "pending",
        "children": [
            "pending_validation",
            "pending_authorization",
        ],
    },
    {
        "name": "processing",
        "children": [
            "processing_gateway",
            "processing_confirmation",
        ],
    },
    "completed",
    "failed",
]

transitions_config = [
    # Pending sub-states
    {
        "trigger": "validate",
        "source": "pending_validation",
        "dest": "pending_authorization",
    },
    {
        "trigger": "authorize",
        "source": "pending_authorization",
        "dest": "processing_gateway",
    },
    # Processing sub-states
    {
        "trigger": "confirm",

    },
    {
        "trigger": "finalize",
        "source": "processing_confirmation",
        "dest": "completed",
    },
    # Failure transitions
    {
        "trigger": "fail",
        "source": "*",
        "dest": "failed",
    },
]

payment = PaymentWorkflow(
    payment_id="PAY-001",
    amount=Decimal("2500"),
)

machine = HierarchicalMachine(
    model=payment,
    states=states,
    transitions=transitions_config,
    initial="pending_validation",
    auto_transitions=False,
)

# Navigate nested states
payment.validate()
assert payment.status == "pending_authorization"

payment.authorize()
assert payment.status == "processing_gateway"

payment.confirm()
assert payment.status == "processing_confirmation"

payment.finalize()
assert payment.status == "completed"
```

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> pending

    state pending {
        [*] --> pending_validation
        pending_validation --> pending_authorization: validate()
    }

    state processing {
        [*] --> processing_gateway
        processing_gateway --> processing_confirmation: confirm()
    }

    pending --> processing: authorize()
    processing --> completed: finalize()

    pending --> failed: fail()
    processing --> failed: fail()
    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]
```

**Why this matters**: Hierarchical states model complex workflows. Sub-states represent phases. Cleaner than flat state machines.

## Financial Domain FSMs

Real-world financial FSMs.

### Zakat Payment Workflow

```mermaid

    validated --> failed: process()<br/>[guard fails]

    processing --> completed: complete()
    processing --> failed: fail()

    completed --> [*]
    failed --> [*]

    note right of pending_validation
        Validate Zakat calculation

        Card/Bank/Cash
    end note

    note right of completed
        Generate receipt
        Notify payer
    end note
```

**Zakat Payment States**:

- **pending**: Initial state, awaiting submission
- **pending_validation**: Validating Zakat amount and method
- **validated**: Validation passed, ready to process
- **processing**: Payment gateway processing
- **completed**: Payment successful, receipt generated

**Why this matters**: FSMs enforce Sharia compliance. Guards validate profit margins. State transitions mirror business processes. Audit trail for compliance.

## FSM Best Practices

### Do: Use Enums for States

```python
# GOOD: Type-safe state enumeration
from enum import Enum


class CampaignState(str, Enum):
    """Type-safe campaign states."""

    DRAFT = "draft"
    ACTIVE = "active"
    COMPLETED = "completed"


# Use with transitions
states = [state.value for state in CampaignState]
```

### Do: Validate State Transitions

```python
# GOOD: Guards enforce business rules
def can_complete_campaign(campaign) -> bool:
    """Validate campaign completion conditions."""
    # Must reach target
    if campaign.current_amount < campaign.target_amount:
        return False

    # Must have minimum donors
    if campaign.donor_count < 10:
        return False

    return True


transitions_config = [
    {
        "trigger": "complete",
        "source": "active",
        "dest": "completed",
        "conditions": "can_complete_campaign",
    }
]
```

### Don't: Mix Business Logic with State Logic

```python
# BAD: Business logic in state class
class ActiveState:
    def record_donation(self, campaign, amount):
        """BAD: Business logic mixed with state logic."""
        campaign.current_amount += amount
        campaign.donor_count += 1
        # Send email, update analytics, etc.


# GOOD: Separate concerns
class ActiveState:
    def record_donation(self, campaign, amount):
        """State logic only - delegate to domain service."""
        donation_service.process_donation(campaign, amount)
```

### Do: Log State Changes

```python
# GOOD: Comprehensive state change logging
def log_state_change(event_data) -> None:
    """Log all state transitions."""
    logger.info(
        f"State transition: {event_data.transition.source} -> {event_data.transition.dest}",
        extra={
            "trigger": event_data.event.name,
            "model_id": event_data.model.id,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        },
    )


machine = Machine(
    model=campaign,
    states=states,
    transitions=transitions_config,
    after_state_change=log_state_change,
)
```
