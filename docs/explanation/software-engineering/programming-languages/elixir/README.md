# Elixir

**This is THE authoritative reference** for Elixir coding standards in OSE Platform.

All Elixir code written for the OSE Platform MUST comply with the standards documented here. These standards are mandatory, not optional. Non-compliance blocks code review and merge approval.

## Framework Stack

OSE Platform Elixir applications MUST use the following framework stack:

**Primary Framework:**

- **Phoenix 1.7+** (Web framework with verified routes, Tailwind support, LiveView streams)
- **Phoenix LiveView** (Real-time UI without JavaScript complexity)

**OTP Stack:**

- **GenServer** for stateful processes and state management
- **Supervisor** for fault tolerance and supervision trees
- **Application** for OTP application structure

**Database & Persistence:**

- **Ecto 3.12+** (Database toolkit with query composition, changesets, migrations)
- **Ecto.Repo** for repository abstraction

**Testing Stack:**

- **ExUnit** (Built-in test framework with doctests and property-based testing)
- **StreamData** for property-based testing
- **White Bread** for BDD scenarios (Gherkin for Elixir)

**Elixir Version Strategy:**

- **Baseline**: Elixir 1.12+ (MUST use minimum) - Scripted Mix install, compilation improvements
- **Recommended**: Elixir 1.17+ (SHOULD migrate to) - Set-theoretic types, calendar durations, OTP 27 support
- **Latest**: Elixir 1.19 (RECOMMENDED for new projects) - Type checking of calls, LSP listeners, enhanced JSON.Encoder protocol

## Prerequisite Knowledge

**REQUIRED**: This documentation assumes you have completed the AyoKoding Elixir learning path. These are **OSE Platform-specific style guides**, not educational tutorials.

**You MUST understand Elixir fundamentals before using these standards:**

- **[Elixir Learning Path](https://ayokoding.com/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/elixir)** - Complete 0-95% language coverage
- **[Elixir By Example](https://ayokoding.com/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/elixir/by-example)** - 75-85 annotated code examples (beginner → advanced)
- **[Elixir In the Field](https://ayokoding.com/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/elixir/in-the-field)** - 36 production guides (OTP-first, Phoenix, Ecto, testing, deployment)
- **[Elixir Release Highlights](https://ayokoding.com/en/learn/software-engineering/programming-languages/elixir/release-highlights)** - 6 major releases (1.12 baseline → 1.17 latest)

**What this documentation covers**: OSE Platform naming conventions, framework choices, repository-specific patterns, how to apply Elixir knowledge in THIS codebase.

**What this documentation does NOT cover**: Elixir syntax, language fundamentals, generic patterns (those are in ayokoding-web).

**See**: [Programming Language Documentation Separation Convention](../../../../../governance/conventions/structure/programming-language-docs-separation.md) for content separation rules.

## Software Engineering Principles

Elixir development in OSE Platform enforces five foundational software engineering principles:

1. **[Automation Over Manual](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)** - MUST automate through Mix build tool, ExUnit testing framework, mix format, Credo for code quality, Dialyzer for static type analysis, and doctests for documentation validation

2. **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)** - MUST enforce explicitness through pattern matching for control flow visibility, explicit error tuples `{:ok, result}` | `{:error, reason}`, supervision strategies explicitly defined, and configuration via `config/runtime.exs`

3. **[Immutability Over Mutability](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/immutability.md)** - MUST use immutable data structures (all Elixir data is immutable by default), pure functions without side effects, data transformations through pipe operator, and functional core/imperative shell architecture

4. **[Pure Functions Over Side Effects](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/pure-functions.md)** - MUST implement pure domain logic without side effects, explicit state management with GenServer, side effects isolated at system boundaries (Ecto, Phoenix), and testable business logic separated from I/O

5. **[Reproducibility First](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/reproducibility.md)** - MUST ensure reproducibility through Mix lock file (`mix.lock`), version pinning in `mix.exs`, asdf/MISE with `.tool-versions` for Elixir and Erlang versions, and deterministic builds

## Elixir Version Strategy

OSE Platform follows a three-tier Elixir versioning strategy:

**Elixir 1.12+ (Baseline - REQUIRED)**:

- All projects MUST support Elixir 1.12 minimum
- Scripted Mix installation improvements
- Enhanced compilation performance
- Improved mix xref for dependency analysis

**Elixir 1.17+ (Target - RECOMMENDED)**:

- Projects SHOULD migrate to Elixir 1.17 when feasible
- Set-theoretic types for additional compile-time warnings
- Duration data type for calendar operations
- Enhanced Dialyzer integration
- Erlang/OTP 27 features (JSON module, process labels)

**Elixir 1.19 (Latest - RECOMMENDED)**:

- New projects SHOULD use Elixir 1.19 for latest stable features
- Type checking of protocols and anonymous functions
- Broader type inference capabilities
- Enhanced compile times (up to 4x faster for large projects)
- Function capture type propagation
- Enhanced JSON.Encoder protocol (JSON module introduced in 1.18)

**Unlike Java's LTS model**: Elixir maintains excellent backward compatibility across versions. Code written for Elixir 1.12 runs on 1.19 without modifications in most cases. Platform strategy focuses on staying current with stable releases.

## Primary Use Cases in OSE Platform

**Real-Time Web Applications**:

- Phoenix LiveView for donation dashboards MUST use real-time updates without complex JavaScript
- WebSocket-based Zakat calculation services SHOULD use Phoenix Channels for bi-directional communication
- Live campaign progress tracking MUST leverage Phoenix PubSub for real-time broadcasts
- Financial analytics dashboards SHOULD use LiveView streams for efficient rendering

**Concurrent Financial Processing**:

- Parallel Zakat calculations for multiple donors MUST use Task.async_stream for concurrent processing
- Distributed Murabaha contract processing SHOULD use GenServer with Registry for process management
- Event-driven Waqf property management MAY use GenStage or Broadway for event pipelines
- High-throughput payment processing MUST leverage BEAM VM's lightweight processes

**Fault-Tolerant Services**:

- Resilient donation processing pipelines MUST use supervision trees for automatic recovery
- Self-healing financial transaction systems SHOULD implement "let it crash" philosophy
- Supervised calculation workers MUST use one_for_one or rest_for_one strategies
- Automatic recovery from failures MUST be handled by supervisors, not defensive code

**Event Sourcing and CQRS**:

- Audit trail for Islamic finance transactions MUST use event sourcing patterns
- Event-driven Zakat payment workflows SHOULD use domain events with Phoenix PubSub
- CQRS for donation campaign management MAY separate read and write models
- Projections for financial reporting MUST rebuild from event streams

## Reproducible Builds and Automation

**Version Management (REQUIRED)**:

- MUST use asdf or MISE with `.tool-versions` to pin Elixir and Erlang versions
- MUST specify Elixir version in `mix.exs` with `elixir: "~> 1.17"` directive
- MUST NOT rely on system-installed Elixir without version verification
- SHOULD document Erlang/OTP version compatibility in README

**Dependency Management (REQUIRED)**:

- MUST use `mix.exs` for dependency declarations with semantic versioning
- MUST commit `mix.lock` for reproducible dependency resolution
- SHOULD use `mix deps.get` to fetch dependencies, not `mix deps.update` in production
- MUST use `mix deps.audit` to check for security vulnerabilities
- MAY use umbrella projects for multi-application monorepos

**Automated Quality (REQUIRED)**:

- MUST use `mix format` for code formatting (enforced in pre-commit hooks)
- MUST use Credo for code quality analysis (minimum score: 90%)
- SHOULD use Dialyzer for static type analysis (with dialyxir for better output)
- MUST achieve >80% test coverage for domain logic (measured with `mix test --cover`)
- SHOULD use mix format check (`mix format --check-formatted`) in CI/CD

**Testing Automation (REQUIRED)**:

- MUST write unit tests with ExUnit (async: true for parallel execution)
- MUST use doctests for public function documentation validation
- SHOULD use property-based testing with StreamData for complex domain logic
- SHOULD use White Bread for BDD acceptance tests where applicable
- MUST run tests in CI/CD with `mix test --trace` for verbose output

**Build Automation (REQUIRED)**:

- MUST use Mix tasks for build automation (`mix compile`, `mix test`, `mix format`)
- SHOULD use `mix release` for production releases with OTP applications
- MUST integrate Credo and Dialyzer in CI/CD pipeline
- SHOULD use pre-commit hooks for `mix format` and `mix credo`

## Integration with Repository Governance

**Development Practices**:

- [Functional Programming](../../../../../governance/development/pattern/functional-programming.md) - MUST follow FP principles for domain logic (pure functions, immutability)
- [Implementation Workflow](../../../../../governance/development/workflow/implementation.md) - MUST follow "make it work → make it right → make it fast" process
- [Code Quality Standards](../../../../../governance/development/quality/code.md) - MUST meet platform-wide quality requirements
- [Commit Messages](../../../../../governance/development/workflow/commit-messages.md) - MUST use Conventional Commits format

**Code Review Requirements**:

- All Elixir code MUST pass automated checks (mix format, Credo, Dialyzer)
- Code reviewers MUST verify compliance with standards in this index
- Non-compliance with mandatory standards (Coding, Testing, Code Quality) blocks merge
- Process leaks and supervision tree design MUST be reviewed for fault tolerance
