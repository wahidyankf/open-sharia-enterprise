# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

**This is THE authoritative reference** for Behavior-Driven Development standards in OSE Platform.

All acceptance criteria and stakeholder-facing specifications MUST follow the BDD methodology and standards documented here.

## BDD Framework and Tool Requirements

**REQUIRED BDD Frameworks:**

- **Java**: Cucumber JVM 7+, JUnit 5 integration
- **TypeScript**: Cucumber.js (NOT Jest-Cucumber)
- **Gherkin Version**: 6.0+

**REQUIRED Collaboration Tools:**

- **Example Mapping**: Physical/virtual color-coded cards (blue/yellow/green/red)
- **Three Amigos Sessions**: Weekly scheduled sessions

**PROHIBITED:**

- Jest-Cucumber (use Cucumber.js)
- SpecFlow without Cucumber JVM alternative
- Writing step definitions before scenarios

## Prerequisite Knowledge

**REQUIRED**: This documentation assumes you have completed the AyoKoding Behavior-Driven Development learning path. These are **OSE Platform-specific BDD standards**, not educational tutorials.

**You MUST understand BDD fundamentals before using these standards:**

- **[Behavior-Driven Development Learning Path](../../../../../apps/ayokoding-web/content/en/learn/software-engineering/development/behavior-driven-development-bdd/)** - Educational foundation for BDD practices
- **[Behavior-Driven Development Overview](../../../../../apps/ayokoding-web/content/en/learn/software-engineering/development/behavior-driven-development-bdd/overview.md)** - Core BDD concepts (Gherkin, Given-When-Then, Three Amigos, Example Mapping)
- **[Behavior-Driven Development By Example](../../../../../apps/ayokoding-web/content/en/learn/software-engineering/development/behavior-driven-development-bdd/by-example/)** - Practical BDD scenarios

**What this documentation covers**: OSE Platform-specific BDD patterns, Islamic finance scenarios, Three Amigos with Shariah scholars, repository-specific feature organization, integration with DDD bounded contexts.

**What this documentation does NOT cover**: BDD fundamentals, basic Gherkin syntax, generic collaboration techniques (those are in ayokoding-web).

**See**: [Programming Language Documentation Separation Convention](../../../../../governance/conventions/structure/programming-language-docs-separation.md) for content separation rules.

## Software Engineering Principles

BDD standards in OSE Platform align with core software engineering principles:

1. **[Documentation First](../../../../../governance/principles/content/documentation-first.md)** - Gherkin scenarios serve as executable specifications written before implementation. Living documentation stays synchronized with code through automated testing.

2. **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)** - Given-When-Then makes preconditions, actions, and outcomes explicit. Ubiquitous language in scenarios eliminates ambiguous requirements.

3. **[Automation Over Manual](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)** - Scenarios execute automatically in CI/CD. Living documentation updates automatically when behavior changes.

4. **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../../../../governance/principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)** - Three Amigos (just 3 roles) prevents bloated meetings. 25-minute Example Mapping time-box prevents over-engineering.

5. **[Reproducibility First](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/reproducibility.md)** - Scenarios in version control ensure reproducible specifications. Deterministic Given steps produce consistent outcomes.

## OSE Platform BDD Standards

### 1. Gherkin Syntax

**[Gherkin Standards](./ex-soen-de-bedrdebd__gherkin-standards.md)**

- REQUIRED: Feature files in `features/` directory
- REQUIRED: Given-When-Then structure
- REQUIRED: Ubiquitous language from DDD glossary

### 2. Scenario Structure

**[Scenario Standards](./ex-soen-de-bedrdebd__scenario-standards.md)**

- REQUIRED: Scenario independence
- REQUIRED: Descriptive scenario names
- REQUIRED: One logical assertion per scenario

### 3. Three Amigos Collaboration

**[Three Amigos Standards](./ex-soen-de-bedrdebd__three-amigos-standards.md)**

- REQUIRED: Weekly Three Amigos sessions
- REQUIRED: Business + Development + QA participation
- REQUIRED: Shariah scholars for Islamic finance features

### 4. Living Documentation

**[Living Documentation Standards](./ex-soen-de-bedrdebd__living-documentation-standards.md)**

- REQUIRED: Scenarios execute in CI/CD
- REQUIRED: Update scenarios when requirements change
- REQUIRED: Generate documentation dashboards

### 5. BDD with Domain-Driven Design

**[BDD with DDD Standards](./ex-soen-de-bedrdebd__bdd-with-ddd-standards.md)**

- REQUIRED: One feature file per bounded context capability
- REQUIRED: Use ubiquitous language in scenarios
- REQUIRED: Domain events in Then steps

## OSE Platform BDD Examples

### Zakat Calculation Feature

```gherkin
Feature: Zakat Calculation for Gold Wealth

  As a Muslim individual
  I want the system to calculate my Zakat obligation on gold wealth
  So that I can fulfill my Islamic religious duty accurately

  Scenario: Wealth exceeds Nisab threshold
    Given a Muslim individual owns 100 grams of gold
    And the Nisab threshold for gold is 87.48 grams
    And one lunar year (Hawl) has passed since acquisition
    When Zakat calculation is performed
    Then Zakat should be obligatory
    And Zakat amount should be 2.5 grams of gold
```

### Contract Approval Workflow

```gherkin
Feature: Murabaha Contract Approval Workflow

  As a Shariah compliance officer
  I want to review and approve Murabaha financing contracts
  So that all contracts meet Shariah compliance standards

  Scenario: Contract meets all Shariah requirements
    Given a Murabaha contract with 5% profit margin
    And the asset is halal and clearly specified
    And the customer agrees to purchase at disclosed price
    When compliance officer reviews the contract
    Then the contract should be approved
    And the contract status should be "SHARIAH_COMPLIANT"
```

### Campaign Donation Tracking

```gherkin
Feature: Donation Campaign Progress Tracking

  As a campaign organizer
  I want to track donations toward campaign goal
  So that donors can see real-time progress

  Scenario: Donation moves campaign closer to goal
    Given a campaign "Build School" with goal of $50,000
    And the campaign has raised $30,000 so far
    When a donor contributes $5,000
    Then the campaign total should be $35,000
    And the progress percentage should be 70%
    And a "DonationReceived" event should be published
```

## Feature File Organization

**REQUIRED Directory Structure:**

```
features/
  zakat-context/
    zakat-calculation.feature
    nisab-threshold-validation.feature

  donation-context/
    campaign-management.feature
    donation-processing.feature

  contract-context/
    murabaha-approval.feature
    contract-lifecycle.feature
```

**File Naming:**

- Feature files: `[domain-capability].feature` (kebab-case)
- Step definitions: `[feature-name].steps.ts` or `[FeatureName]Steps.java`

## Three Amigos Sessions

**REQUIRED Participants:**

- **Business**: Product Owner or Domain Expert (Shariah scholar for Islamic finance)

- Open questions documented

## Coverage Requirements

**REQUIRED Coverage:**

- Happy path scenarios for all user-facing features
- Critical error scenarios (validation failures, permission denied)
- Edge cases identified during Three Amigos sessions

**PROHIBITED:**

- Testing internal implementation details
- Testing framework code
- Scenarios that duplicate unit tests

## Validation Checklist

Before merging feature files, verify:

- [ ] **Gherkin syntax correct**: Feature, Scenario, Given-When-Then structure
- [ ] **Ubiquitous language used**: Terms match DDD glossary
- [ ] **Scenario independence**: Each scenario runs in any order
- [ ] **Three Amigos approval**: Business, Dev, QA reviewed scenarios
- [ ] **Shariah scholar approval**: Islamic finance features reviewed by scholar
- [ ] **Step definitions implemented**: All Given/When/Then steps have code
- [ ] **Scenarios execute**: All scenarios pass in CI/CD
- [ ] **Living documentation updated**: Docs dashboard reflects latest scenarios

## Related Standards

- **[Test-Driven Development Standards](../test-driven-development-tdd/README.md)** - Unit testing with TDD
- **[Domain-Driven Design Standards](../../architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/README.md)** - Ubiquitous language, bounded contexts
- **[Java Coding Standards](../../programming-languages/java/README.md)** - Java step definition conventions
- **[TypeScript Coding Standards](../../programming-languages/typescript/README.md)** - TypeScript step definition conventions

## Principles Implemented

- **[Documentation First](../../../../../governance/principles/content/documentation-first.md)**: By writing Gherkin scenarios before implementation, requirements become executable documentation that drives development and validation.

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)**: By using Given-When-Then structure and ubiquitous language, scenarios make preconditions, actions, and outcomes explicit rather than assuming context.

- **[Automation Over Manual](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)**: By executing scenarios automatically in CI/CD, BDD eliminates manual acceptance testing and ensures living documentation stays current.
