# Architecture

**Understanding-oriented documentation** on software architecture patterns, models, and design approaches for building scalable, maintainable enterprise systems.

## Overview

**The Challenge**: You're building a complex system. Stakeholders ask "how does it work?" Junior developers ask "where should this code go?" Teams in different contexts use different terms for the same concept. Architecture documentation gets outdated the moment you write it.

**Our Approach**: We combine two complementary practices that solve different but related problems:

1. **C4 Architecture Model** - Visual communication of software architecture through hierarchical diagrams
2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - Strategic and tactical patterns for modeling complex business domains

These approaches work together to help teams design, communicate, and implement robust software systems that align with business needs while maintaining technical excellence.

## Why Architecture Documentation Matters

Clear architecture documentation delivers tangible benefits:

- **Faster Onboarding** - New developers understand system structure in hours instead of weeks
- **Better Communication** - Stakeholders, developers, and domain experts share a common visual language
- **Reduced Technical Debt** - Explicit boundaries and responsibilities prevent "big ball of mud" architectures
- **Confident Evolution** - Teams make changes knowing the ripple effects and integration points

### 🎨 [C4 Architecture Model](./c4-architecture-model/README.md)

**Visualizing software architecture through hierarchical abstraction levels**

The C4 model provides a systematic way to create architecture diagrams at four levels of detail (Context, Container, Component, Code). Created by Simon Brown, it offers a developer-friendly alternative to heavyweight modeling approaches.

**Use C4 when you need to:**

- Create clear, consistent architecture diagrams for diverse audiences
- Document systems at multiple levels of abstraction
- Communicate technical decisions to both developers and stakeholders
- Maintain lightweight but rigorous architecture documentation

### 🏛️ [Domain-Driven Design (DDD)](./domain-driven-design-ddd/README.md)

**Strategic and tactical patterns for modeling complex business domains**

Domain-Driven Design places the business domain at the center of software design. Introduced by Eric Evans in 2003, DDD helps teams manage complexity in large-scale systems.

DDD provides two complementary pattern sets: strategic design for understanding the business and tactical patterns for implementing the domain model.

**Use DDD when you have:**

- Complex business logic with numerous rules and invariants
- Access to domain experts for collaboration
- Long-lived systems expected to evolve over years
- High cost of defects or regulatory compliance requirements

## How C4 and DDD Work Together

C4 and DDD complement each other throughout the design process:

| DDD Concept             | Maps to C4 Level | Purpose                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Maps**        | System Context   | Shows how bounded contexts relate to external systems         |
| **Bounded Contexts**    | Containers       | Each bounded context typically becomes one or more containers |
| **Aggregates**          | Components       | Major aggregates often become components within a container   |
| **Domain Events**       | Dynamic Diagrams | Event flows visualized across components and containers       |
| **Ubiquitous Language** | Diagram Labels   | Consistent terminology across all diagrams                    |

**Example workflow:**

1. Use **Event Storming** (DDD) to discover domain events and bounded contexts
2. Create **Context Map** (DDD) showing relationships between bounded contexts
3. Draw **System Context diagram** (C4) showing bounded contexts as containers
4. Design **Aggregates** (DDD) within each bounded context
5. Create **Component diagrams** (C4) showing aggregates and their relationships
6. Document **runtime behavior** with Dynamic diagrams (C4) and Domain Events (DDD)

See DDD and C4 Integration for comprehensive examples and guidance.
