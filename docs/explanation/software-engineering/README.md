# Software Design

**Understanding-oriented documentation** on software design patterns, architectural models, and design practices for building complex enterprise systems.

## What is Software Design?

Software design encompasses the fundamental structures of a software system—the building blocks, their relationships, and the principles governing their design and evolution. Good design documentation helps teams:

- **Communicate design decisions** across technical and non-technical stakeholders
- **Manage complexity** through clear boundaries and abstractions
- **Guide implementation** while maintaining design consistency
- **Evolve systems** systematically as requirements change

- **[Software Design Reference](./ex-soen__software-design-reference.md)** - Cross-reference index to all software design documentation. Links architecture patterns, development practices, and language-specific standards

## Why This Structure?

**Three complementary dimensions of software design:**

- **Architecture** answers _"What are we building?"_ - System structure, boundaries, and strategic design decisions
- **Development** answers _"How do we build reliably?"_ - Testing practices that ensure correctness and alignment with requirements
- **Programming Languages** answers _"How do we write idiomatic code?"_ - Language-specific patterns that leverage each language's strengths

**Think of it as:**

- **Architecture** = Building blueprint (rooms, walls, plumbing)
- **Development** = Construction methodology (inspection checkpoints, quality control)
- **Languages** = Craftsmanship (how to properly use tools and materials)

All three work together: you need good architecture to know what to build, solid development practices to build it correctly, and language expertise to build it idiomatically.

## Architecture Documentation

This section covers two complementary approaches to software architecture:

1. **C4 Architecture Model** - How to visualize and communicate design through hierarchical diagrams
2. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** - How to design systems that reflect complex business domains

## C4 and DDD Overview

### 🎨 C4 Architecture Model

**Visualizing software architecture through hierarchical abstraction levels**

The C4 model provides a systematic way to create architecture diagrams at four levels of detail (Context, Container, Component, Code). Created by Simon Brown, it offers a developer-friendly alternative to heavyweight modeling approaches.

**Use C4 when you need to:**

- Create clear, consistent architecture diagrams for diverse audiences
- Document systems at multiple levels of abstraction
- Communicate technical decisions to both developers and stakeholders
- Maintain lightweight but rigorous architecture documentation

**Learn more:** [C4 Architecture Model Documentation](./architecture/c4-architecture-model/README.md)

**Key topics:**

- System Context diagrams (system boundaries and external dependencies)
- Container diagrams (high-level technical building blocks)
- Component diagrams (internal structure of containers)
- Code diagrams (implementation details)
- Dynamic diagrams (runtime behavior)
- Deployment diagrams (infrastructure mapping)

### 🏛️ Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Strategic and tactical patterns for modeling complex business domains**

Domain-Driven Design is a software development approach that places the business domain at the center of design. Introduced by Eric Evans in 2003, DDD provides patterns for managing complexity in large-scale systems through strategic design (understanding the business) and tactical patterns (implementing the model).

**Use DDD when you have:**

- Complex business logic with numerous rules and invariants
- Access to domain experts for collaboration
- Long-lived systems expected to evolve over years
- High cost of defects or regulatory compliance requirements

**Learn more:** [Domain-Driven Design Documentation](./architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/README.md)

**Key topics:**

- Strategic patterns: Bounded Contexts, Context Mapping, Subdomains, Ubiquitous Language
- Tactical patterns: Aggregates, Entities, Value Objects, Repositories, Domain Events
- Event Storming and collaborative design workshops
- Functional programming adaptations for DDD
- Integration with layered and hexagonal architectures

## How C4 and DDD Work Together

C4 and DDD complement each other throughout the design process:

| DDD Concept             | Maps to C4 Level | Purpose                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Maps**        | System Context   | Shows how bounded contexts relate to external systems         |
| **Bounded Contexts**    | Containers       | Each bounded context typically becomes one or more containers |
| **Aggregates**          | Components       | Major aggregates often become components within a container   |
| **Domain Events**       | Dynamic Diagrams | Event flows visualized across components and containers       |
| **Ubiquitous Language** | Diagram Labels   | Consistent terminology across all diagrams                    |

**Example workflow:**

1. Use **Event Storming** (DDD) to discover domain events and bounded contexts
2. Create **Context Map** (DDD) showing relationships between bounded contexts
3. Draw **System Context diagram** (C4) showing bounded contexts as containers
4. Design **Aggregates** (DDD) within each bounded context
5. Create **Component diagrams** (C4) showing aggregates and their relationships
6. Document **runtime behavior** with Dynamic diagrams (C4) and Domain Events (DDD)

See [DDD and C4 Integration](./architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/README.md) for comprehensive examples.

## Design in This Repository

The open-sharia-enterprise project applies both C4 and DDD principles:

**C4 Model Usage:**

- All design diagrams use C4 conventions
- WCAG AA-compliant color palette for accessibility
- Mermaid diagrams for version-controlled documentation
- Multiple abstraction levels for different audiences

**DDD Application:**

- Bounded contexts align with Nx project boundaries
- Business domains modeled with Ubiquitous Language (Tax, Loan, Donation)
- Functional programming adaptations (immutable aggregates, pure domain logic)
- Event-driven architecture with Domain Events

**Complementary Practices:**

- [Functional Programming](../../../governance/development/pattern/functional-programming.md) - Immutability and pure functions
- [Repository Governance Architecture](../../../governance/repository-governance-architecture.md) - Six-layer hierarchy
- [Diátaxis Framework](../../../governance/conventions/structure/diataxis-framework.md) - Documentation organization
