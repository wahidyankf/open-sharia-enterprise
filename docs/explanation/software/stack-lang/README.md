# Programming Languages

**Understanding-oriented documentation** on language-specific idioms, best practices, and antipatterns for programming languages used in the open-sharia-enterprise platform.

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive documentation on programming languages used throughout the platform. Each language has three core documents:

1. **Idioms** - Language-specific patterns, conventions, and idiomatic code styles
2. **Best Practices** - Proven approaches for writing clean, maintainable code
3. **Antipatterns** - Common mistakes and pitfalls to avoid

## Purpose

Understanding language-specific idioms and patterns helps developers:

- Write code that follows established conventions
- Leverage language features effectively
- Avoid common pitfalls and mistakes
- Maintain consistency across the codebase
- Onboard new team members efficiently

## Documentation Structure

### Language Coverage

Each language directory contains:

```
[language-name]/
├── README.md                           # Language overview and version info
├── ex-so-stla-[la]__idioms.md    # Language-specific idioms
├── ex-so-stla-[la]__best-practices.md  # Best practices
└── ex-so-stla-[la]__antipatterns.md    # Common antipatterns
```

### Document Categories

**Idioms** focus on:

- Language-specific patterns and conventions
- Effective use of language features
- Standard library usage patterns
- Ecosystem conventions
- Community-established norms

**Best Practices** cover:

- Code organization and structure
- Naming conventions
- Error handling approaches
- Testing strategies
- Performance considerations
- Security practices

**Antipatterns** identify:

- Common mistakes and misuses
- Performance pitfalls
- Security vulnerabilities
- Maintainability issues
- Anti-idiomatic code patterns

## Languages Documented

### ☕ [Java](./java/README.md)

**Modern Java development with records, pattern matching, and virtual threads**

Java is a primary language for backend services, particularly for domain-driven design and enterprise features. The platform uses modern Java (17+) with emphasis on functional programming, immutability, and structured concurrency.

**Key Documentation:**

- [Java Idioms](./java/ex-so-stla-ja__idioms.md) - Records, pattern matching, Optional, Stream API
- [Java Best Practices](./java/ex-so-stla-ja__best-practices.md) - Modern Java standards (2025-2026)
- [Java Antipatterns](./java/ex-so-stla-ja__antipatterns.md) - Common mistakes to avoid

**Use Java when you need:**

- Strong type safety and compile-time guarantees
- Enterprise integration (Jakarta EE, Spring ecosystem)
- High-performance concurrent processing
- Complex domain models (DDD tactical patterns)
- Mature tooling and ecosystem

## How Languages Fit into the Platform

### Language Selection Criteria

Languages in this documentation are chosen based on:

**Technical Fit**:

- Type safety and correctness guarantees
- Performance characteristics
- Ecosystem maturity
- Tooling support

**Development Practices**:

- Alignment with functional programming principles
- Support for immutability and pure functions
- Testing and maintainability
- Community best practices

**Platform Integration**:

- Nx monorepo compatibility
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Deployment and containerization
- Observability and monitoring

### Current Language Usage

| Language       | Primary Use Cases                               | Status                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Java**       | Backend services, domain models, business logic | Active                             |
| **TypeScript** | Frontend applications, Node.js services         | Planned                            |
| **Go**         | CLI tools, infrastructure services              | Active (butler-cli, ayokoding-cli) |
| **Python**     | Data processing, AI/ML integration              | Planned                            |

## Learning Paths

### For Backend Developers

1. **Start with Java fundamentals** - Read [Java Idioms](./java/ex-so-stla-ja__idioms.md)
2. **Apply modern practices** - Read [Java Best Practices](./java/ex-so-stla-ja__best-practices.md)
3. **Avoid common pitfalls** - Read [Java Antipatterns](./java/ex-so-stla-ja__antipatterns.md)
4. **Integrate with DDD** - Read [DDD and Java](../architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/README.md)

### For Full-Stack Developers

1. Learn both backend (Java) and frontend (TypeScript) idioms
2. Understand language-specific testing approaches
3. Apply consistent patterns across languages
4. Practice polyglot development

### For New Team Members

1. Read idioms document for your primary language
2. Review best practices for code standards
3. Study antipatterns to avoid common mistakes
4. Cross-reference with repository conventions

## Complementary Documentation

This language documentation complements other areas:

- **[Development Practices](../development/README.md)** - TDD, BDD, testing strategies
- **[Architecture](../architecture/README.md)** - C4 model, DDD patterns
- **[Functional Programming](../../../../governance/development/pattern/functional-programming.md)** - Cross-language FP principles
- **[Code Quality Standards](../../../../governance/development/quality/code.md)** - Quality requirements
- **[Monorepo Structure](../../../reference/re__monorepo-structure.md)** - Project organization

## Principles Reflected in Language Documentation

All language documentation follows the repository's core principles:

**Simplicity Over Complexity**:

- Prefer simple, clear code over clever solutions
- Use language features appropriately, not excessively
- Favor readability over premature optimization

**Explicit Over Implicit**:

- Make dependencies and behavior explicit
- Avoid magic and hidden complexity
- Use clear, descriptive naming

**Immutability First**:

- Prefer immutable data structures
- Use functional programming patterns
- Minimize mutable state

**Security by Design**:

- Follow language-specific security best practices
- Validate inputs at system boundaries
- Apply principle of least privilege

## Contributing Language Documentation

### Adding a New Language

To document a new language:

1. Create directory: `docs/explanation/software/stack-lang/[language-name]/`
2. Create README.md with language overview
3. Create three core documents:
   - `ex-so-stlag-[abbr]__idioms.md`
   - `ex-so-stlag-[abbr]__best-practices.md`
   - `ex-so-stlag-[abbr]__antipatterns.md`
4. Update this README.md with language section
5. Cross-reference with relevant documentation

### Updating Existing Documentation

- Keep content current with language evolution
- Cite authoritative sources (official docs, style guides)
- Include code examples from the platform when possible
- Mark deprecated patterns and suggest modern alternatives
- Update "Last Updated" date in frontmatter
