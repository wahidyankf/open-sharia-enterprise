# Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) Documentation

Comprehensive documentation on Behavior-Driven Development patterns, principles, and practices for building software through concrete examples and stakeholder collaboration. This documentation covers Gherkin syntax, Three Amigos practice, Example Mapping, and BDD integration with Test-Driven Development and Domain-Driven Design, with examples from finance and business domains.

## What is Behavior-Driven Development?

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a collaborative software development approach that extends Test-Driven Development by emphasizing communication between developers, QA engineers, and business stakeholders through concrete examples. Introduced by Dan North in 2003, BDD uses natural language to specify expected behavior before writing code, ensuring all team members share a common understanding of requirements.

**Key Principles:**

- **Collaboration First**: Three Amigos (Business, Development, QA) work together to define requirements
- **Concrete Examples**: Specification by Example reduces ambiguity and misunderstanding
- **Outside-In Development**: Start from user needs and work inward to implementation
- **Living Documentation**: Executable specifications that stay synchronized with code
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Shared vocabulary between technical and non-technical team members
- **Stakeholder Involvement**: Domain experts actively participate in requirements discovery

    style E fill:#CC78BC,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
    style G fill:#029E73,stroke:#000000,color:#FFFFFF
```

**The Workflow Explained:**

1. **🤝 DISCOVERY** - Three Amigos collaborate to explore feature requirements through examples
2. **💡 FORMULATION** - Write concrete scenarios in Gherkin (Given-When-Then format)
3. **⚙️ AUTOMATION** - Implement step definitions that connect scenarios to application code
4. **🧪 EXECUTION** - Run automated scenarios (BDD tests guide TDD implementation)
5. **📚 LIVING DOCS** - Scenarios become executable documentation that must stay current
6. **🔄 ITERATE** - When requirements evolve, update scenarios and repeat

**Core Philosophy:**

BDD is not about tools (like Cucumber)—it's about **conversation**. The real value comes from:

1. **Discovering requirements** through collaborative conversation before implementation
2. **Reducing ambiguity** by using concrete examples instead of abstract descriptions
3. **Building shared understanding** across the entire team, not just developers
4. **Maintaining living documentation** that never goes stale because it must pass for code to work
5. **Focusing on behavior** (what the system does) rather than implementation details (how it works)

### History and Evolution

- **2003**: Dan North introduces Behavior-Driven Development while teaching TDD, addressing confusion about "where to start" and "what to test"
- **2003-2004**: Dan North creates JBehave, the first BDD framework
- **2006**: Dan North publishes "Introducing BDD" article formalizing the methodology
- **2008**: Aslak Hellesøy creates Cucumber and introduces Gherkin (Given-When-Then syntax) for natural language specifications
- **2011**: Gojko Adzic publishes "Specification by Example" - formalizes collaborative requirements discovery
- **2015**: Matt Wynne introduces Example Mapping technique through article (presented earlier at BDDX 2014)
- **2015+**: BDD expands beyond Cucumber - BDD principles applied to various testing frameworks and languages
- **2020+**: BDD integrates with modern practices (DDD, microservices, API-first development)

### When to Use BDD: Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to determine if BDD is appropriate for your project. Score each dimension from 1-5, then calculate total.

| Dimension                   | Score 1-2 (Low)                          | Score 3 (Medium)                     | Score 4-5 (High)                                              |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stakeholder Involvement** | Solo developer, no domain experts        | Occasional stakeholder input         | Active domain experts, frequent collaboration                 |
| **Requirements Complexity** | Simple, well-understood features         | Moderate complexity, some edge cases | Complex rules with many scenarios and edge cases              |
| **Team Distribution**       | Co-located team, easy face-to-face       | Partially distributed, some async    | Fully distributed, async communication required               |
| **Domain Complexity**       | Technical domain, minimal business logic | Moderate business rules              | Complex business domain requiring expert knowledge            |
| **Communication Barriers**  | Shared understanding, clear terms        | Occasional misunderstandings         | Frequent miscommunication, ambiguous requirements             |
| **Documentation Need**      | Code comments sufficient                 | Basic docs needed for onboarding     | Living documentation critical (regulatory, audit, compliance) |

**Scoring Guide:**

- **24-30 points**: BDD strongly recommended - high complexity, stakeholder involvement critical
- **16-23 points**: BDD recommended - clear collaboration and documentation value
- **10-15 points**: BDD optional - evaluate based on team preference and learning goals
- **6-9 points**: Consider lightweight collaboration instead of full BDD

**Example: Tax Calculation System with Compliance Scholars**

- Stakeholder Involvement: **5** (Compliance scholars must validate religious rules)
- Requirements Complexity: **5** (multiple asset types, threshold thresholds, Hawl calculations, exemptions)
- Team Distribution: **4** (developers + scholars potentially in different locations)
- Domain Complexity: **5** (Islamic jurisprudence requires expert interpretation)
- Communication Barriers: **4** (technical vs. religious terminology, translation between domains)
- Documentation Need: **5** (regulatory reporting, audit trail, religious compliance)

**Total: 29 points** → BDD strongly recommended

### When to Use BDD

BDD is ideal for:

- **Complex business domains** requiring domain expert collaboration (Islamic finance, healthcare, compliance)
- **Stakeholder-driven projects** where business validates each feature (product companies, consulting projects)
- **Distributed teams** needing asynchronous communication and clear requirements (remote teams, outsourcing)
- **Regulatory compliance** requiring auditable specifications (financial services, healthcare, legal)
- **Long-lived systems** where living documentation prevents knowledge loss over time
- **Cross-functional teams** with developers, QA, product owners, domain experts
- **API development** where contract clarity prevents integration issues

### When NOT to Use BDD

BDD may not be appropriate for:

- **Solo developer projects** without stakeholders (personal projects, internal tools)
- **Purely technical systems** with no business logic (infrastructure, devops tooling)
- **Simple CRUD applications** where behavior is obvious (basic admin panels)
- **Prototypes and spikes** where requirements are exploratory (proof of concepts)
- **Teams without buy-in** - BDD requires collaboration, not just tool adoption
- **Pure algorithm work** where correctness is mathematical, not behavioral (cryptography, data structures)

**Note**: Even in these cases, **some** collaboration and concrete examples are valuable. The question is whether to adopt full BDD practices (Three Amigos, Example Mapping, Gherkin scenarios) or lightweight alternatives.

## BDD and Software Engineering Principles

## Relationship to Other Documentation

BDD integrates with other software design approaches in this repository:

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**[Test-Driven Development Documentation](../test-driven-development-tdd/README.md)**

- **Complementary Practices**: BDD (acceptance tests, behavior specification) + TDD (unit tests, design technique)
- **Outside-In Development**: BDD scenarios → TDD implementation
- **Double Loop**: Outer BDD loop (acceptance criteria) + Inner TDD loop (unit-level design)
- **Shared Philosophy**: Test-first, small steps, refactoring with safety net
- **Different Focus**: BDD (stakeholder collaboration, behavior) vs. TDD (developer-focused, design)

**Key Integration**: File 13 provides comprehensive guidance on using BDD and TDD together.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**[Domain-Driven Design Documentation](../../architecture/domain-driven-design-ddd/README.md)**

- **Ubiquitous Language**: BDD scenarios use DDD terminology (Tax, Threshold, Hawl, Loan)
- **Features per Bounded Context**: Feature files align with bounded context boundaries
- **Domain Events**: Scenarios capture domain events (TaxCalculated, CertificationApproved)
- **Aggregate Testing**: BDD scenarios verify aggregate invariants and business rules
- **Strategic Alignment**: BDD Discovery sessions inform strategic DDD design

**Key Integration**: File 14 shows how BDD naturally aligns with DDD practices.

### C4 Architecture Model

**[C4 Architecture Model Documentation](../../architecture/c4-architecture-model/README.md)**

- **System Context Level**: BDD scenarios test external system integrations
- **Container Level**: Feature files map to containers (services, applications)
- **Component Level**: Step definitions interact with components
- **BDD Documentation**: Living documentation complements C4 diagrams

### Functional Programming

**[Functional Programming Principles](../../../../../governance/development/pattern/functional-programming.md)**

- **Pure Step Definitions**: Step implementations as pure functions
- **Immutable Test Data**: Test data builders using immutable data structures
- **Property-Based Testing**: BDD scenarios + property-based testing for comprehensive coverage
- **Railway-Oriented Programming**: Step definitions handle validation and errors

### Implementation Workflow

**[Implementation Workflow](../../../../../governance/development/workflow/implementation.md)**

BDD aligns with "Make it work → Make it right → Make it fast":

1. **Make it work** (Discovery): Collaborate on scenarios, implement step definitions
2. **Make it right** (Refactoring): Improve step definitions and domain code
3. **Make it fast** (Optimization): Optimize slow scenarios, parallel execution

## Domain Examples Throughout Documentation

Examples focus on **Compliance-compliant business systems**:

### Core Domain: Tax Calculation

Islamic almsgiving with precise jurisprudence rules:

**Example Feature**:

```gherkin
Feature: Tax Threshold Threshold Validation

  Scenario: Wealth meets gold threshold threshold
    Given a Muslim individual owns 100 grams of gold
    And the threshold threshold for gold is 85 grams
    And one lunar year (Hawl) has passed since acquisition
    When Tax calculation is performed
    Then Tax should be obligatory
    And Tax amount should be 2.5 grams of gold

  Scenario: Wealth below threshold threshold
    Given a Muslim individual owns 50 grams of gold
    And the threshold threshold for gold is 85 grams
    When Tax calculation is performed
    Then Tax should not be obligatory
    And Tax amount should be 0 grams
```

### Supporting Domain: Permitted Certification

Product compliance verification:

**Example Scenario**:

```gherkin
Scenario: Certify product with permitted ingredients
  Given a product "Organic Dates" with ingredients:
    | Ingredient | Status |
    | Dates      | Permitted  |
    | Water      | Permitted  |
  When certification authority verifies ingredients
  Then product should receive permitted certification
  And certification should be valid for 12 months
```

## Getting Started

Ready to apply BDD to your project? Start here:

1. **Assess suitability**: Use [Decision Matrix](#when-to-use-bdd-decision-matrix) to score your project
2. **Learn Gherkin**: Read [Gherkin Syntax](./ex-so-de-bdd__02-gherkin-syntax-and-scenarios.md) and write first scenario
3. **Run Three Amigos**: Schedule session using [Three Amigos Template](./templates/ex-so-de-bdd-te__three-amigos-session-template.md)
4. **Try Example Mapping**: Visual workshop using [Example Mapping Guide](./ex-so-de-bdd__05-example-mapping.md)
5. **Choose framework**: Review [BDD Frameworks](./ex-so-de-bdd__11-bdd-frameworks.md) comparison
6. **Write first feature**: Use [Feature File Template](./templates/ex-so-de-bdd-te__feature-file-template.md)
7. **Implement steps**: Follow [Step Definitions Guide](./ex-so-de-bdd__09-step-definitions.md)

## Related Principles

BDD practices demonstrate alignment with core software engineering principles:

- **[Explicit Over Implicit](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/explicit-over-implicit.md)** - Given-When-Then structure explicitly declares preconditions, actions, expectations. Specification by Example replaces ambiguous abstractions with concrete scenarios. Ubiquitous language makes domain terminology explicit across all communication.

- **[Simplicity Over Complexity](../../../../../governance/principles/general/simplicity-over-complexity.md)** - Example Mapping's 25-minute time-box prevents over-analysis. Three Amigos (3 roles) provides just enough perspectives without bloated meetings. Gherkin syntax prioritizes readability over complex notation.

- **[Automation Over Manual](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/automation-over-manual.md)** - Living documentation automates specification verification. CI/CD integration automates scenario execution, replacing manual regression testing. Executable specifications ensure documentation stays current automatically.

- **[Reproducibility First](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/reproducibility.md)** - Version-controlled feature files enable reproducible specifications across teams and time. Deterministic Given steps ensure same preconditions produce same outcomes. No flaky tests—scenarios pass consistently.

- **[Immutability Over Mutability](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/immutability.md)** - Independent scenarios avoid shared mutable state. Each scenario establishes its own preconditions without depending on prior scenario state changes.

See [Software Engineering Principles](../../../../../governance/principles/software-engineering/README.md) for comprehensive documentation of foundational principles guiding BDD.
