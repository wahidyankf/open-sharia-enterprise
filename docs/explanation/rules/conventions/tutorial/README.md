# Tutorial Conventions

Tutorial creation, structure, naming, and content standards for educational content.

## Purpose

These conventions define **HOW to create and structure tutorials**, covering tutorial types, depth levels, naming standards, programming language content architecture, and by-example tutorial formats. These standards ensure consistent, high-quality learning experiences.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Tutorial structure and organization
- Tutorial naming and depth levels
- Programming language education architecture
- By-example tutorial standards
- Tutorial quality requirements

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- General content quality (that's content/)
- Markdown formatting (that's formatting/)
- Hugo-specific content rules (that's hugo/)

## Conventions

- [By Example Tutorial](./ex-ru-co-tu__by-example.md) - Standards for code-first by-example tutorials with 75-90 heavily annotated examples achieving 95% coverage
- [General Tutorial Convention](./ex-ru-co-tu__general.md) - Standards for creating learning-oriented tutorials with narrative flow and progressive scaffolding
- [Programming Language Content Standard](./ex-ru-co-tu__programming-language-content.md) - Universal content architecture for programming language education on ayokoding-web
- [Programming Language Tutorial Structure](./ex-ru-co-tu__programming-language-structure.md) - Dual-path tutorial organization (by-concept and by-example) for programming languages
- [Tutorial Naming](./ex-ru-co-tu__naming.md) - Standardized tutorial types and depth levels (Initial Setup, Quick Start, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Cookbook)
