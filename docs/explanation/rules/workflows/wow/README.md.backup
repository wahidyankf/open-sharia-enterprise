# Repository Rules Workflows

Orchestrated workflows for validating repository-wide consistency across principles, conventions, development practices, agents, and CLAUDE.md.

## Purpose

These workflows define **WHEN and HOW to validate repository rules**, orchestrating wow**rules-checker and wow**rules-fixer agents to ensure consistency across all governance layers (principles, conventions, development practices, agents, CLAUDE.md).

## Scope

**✅ Workflows Here:**

- Repository-wide consistency validation
- Cross-layer governance checking
- CLAUDE.md synchronization validation
- Agent standards enforcement
- Iterative check-fix-verify cycles

**❌ Not Included:**

- Content quality validation (that's docs/)
- Hugo content validation (that's ayokoding-web/)
- Plan validation (that's plan/)

## Workflows

- [Repository Rules Quality Gate](./ex-wf-wo__rules-quality-gate.md) - Validate repository consistency across all layers (principles, conventions, development, agents, CLAUDE.md) and apply fixes iteratively until ZERO findings. Supports four strictness modes (lax, normal, strict, ocd)
