# Workflow Development

Development workflow standards covering implementation methodology, git workflows, commit messages, and reproducible environments.

## Purpose

These standards define **HOW to execute development workflows**, covering the three-stage implementation workflow (make it work, make it right, make it fast), Trunk Based Development for git, Conventional Commits for messages, and reproducible environment practices.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Development workflow methodologies
- Git workflow standards (TBD, commits)
- Implementation progression (work → right → fast)
- Environment reproducibility practices
- Development process standards

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Why we automate workflows (that's a principle)
- Multi-agent orchestration (that's workflows/)
- Code quality tools (that's quality/)
