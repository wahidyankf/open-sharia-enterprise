# Development Patterns

Reusable software development patterns and practices for consistent, high-quality code.

## Purpose

These patterns define **HOW to structure development workflows and code**, covering the Maker-Checker-Fixer quality workflow and functional programming practices. These are proven patterns that solve common development challenges.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Reusable development patterns
- Workflow patterns (maker-checker-fixer)
- Programming paradigm practices (functional programming)
- Code organization patterns

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Why we value patterns (that's a principle)
- Specific tool configuration (that's workflow/)
- Language-specific syntax (that's reference docs)

## Documents

- [Functional Programming Practices](./ex-de-pa__functional-programming.md) - Guidelines for applying functional programming principles in TypeScript/JavaScript (immutability patterns, pure functions, function composition)
- [Maker-Checker-Fixer Pattern](./ex-de-pa__maker-checker-fixer.md) - Three-stage quality workflow for content creation and validation with user review gates and confidence level integration
