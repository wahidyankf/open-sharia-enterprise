# Information Security Toolings

This directory contains conceptual documentation about specific security testing tools used in offensive and defensive security practices.

## 📋 Contents

### 🔍 Reconnaissance & Discovery

- [Gobuster](./ex-inse-to__gobuster.md) - Directory and file brute-forcing tool for web application enumeration

## 🔗 Related Documentation

- [Information Security Index](../README.md) - Core security concepts
- [Offensive Security](../ex-inse__offensive-security.md) - Active security testing and penetration testing
- [Defensive Security](../ex-inse__defensive-security.md) - Protection strategies and defensive practices
- [DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)](../ex-inse__dast.md) - Runtime security testing

## 🎯 Purpose

Security tools are essential for both offensive security testing (finding vulnerabilities) and defensive security (understanding attack vectors). This section explains what these tools do, how they work, and when to use them in authorized security testing contexts.

**Important**: All tools documented here should only be used in authorized contexts such as:

- Penetration testing engagements with proper authorization
- CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions
- Security research on systems you own or have permission to test
- Educational and training purposes
- Defensive security analysis

Unauthorized use of these tools against systems you don't own or have explicit permission to test is illegal and unethical.
