# Software Engineering Principles

Software engineering-specific foundational principles governing development practices, configuration, automation, and code organization.

## Purpose

These principles define **WHY we value specific approaches to software development**, covering configuration philosophy, automation strategies, code organization, and technical decision-making. All development practices implement these principles.

## Scope

**✅ Belongs Here:**

- Foundational values about software development
- Philosophical stances on automation and configuration
- Beliefs about code quality and organization
- Reasons behind technical standards

**❌ Does NOT Belong:**

- Specific coding standards (that's a development practice)
- How-to implement features (that's a guide)
- Technical tool configurations (that's a development practice)

## Principles

- [Automation Over Manual](./ex-pr-se__automation-over-manual.md) - Automate repetitive tasks to ensure consistency and reduce human error
- [Explicit Over Implicit](./ex-pr-se__explicit-over-implicit.md) - Choose explicit composition and configuration over magic, convenience, and hidden behavior
- [Immutability Over Mutability](./ex-pr-se__immutability.md) - Prefer immutable data structures over mutable state
- [Pure Functions Over Side Effects](./ex-pr-se__pure-functions.md) - Prefer pure functions (deterministic, no side effects) over functions with side effects
- [Reproducibility First](./ex-pr-se__reproducibility.md) - Development environments and builds should be reproducible from the start
