  - **🎯 [Offensive Security](../../explanation/information-security/ex-in-se__offensive-security.md) Short Summary**
    - Offensive security is the practice of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities from an attacker's perspective to strengthen defensive measures
    - **Key Disciplines:**
      - **Penetration Testing** - Authorized security testing to find and exploit vulnerabilities
      - **Red Teaming** - Simulating full-scale attacks to test organizational defenses
      - **Vulnerability Research** - Discovering new vulnerabilities in systems and software
      - **Security Assessment** - Evaluating security posture through active testing
    - **Purpose:** Find weaknesses before malicious actors do; validate defensive controls work
    - **Mindset:** Think like an attacker, understand attack vectors, test assumptions
    - **Relationship to InfoSec:**
      - Complements defensive security (blue team)
      - SAST/DAST are defensive testing approaches
      - Offensive testing validates that defenses actually prevent attacks
      - Together they form a comprehensive security strategy
    - **For Fintech:**
      - Critical for validating transaction security
      - Tests authentication/authorization bypass attempts
      - Validates API security controls
      - Confirms encryption and data protection work in practice
  - **🛡️ [Defensive Security](../../explanation/information-security/ex-in-se__defensive-security.md) Short Summary**
    - Defensive security is the practice of protecting systems, networks, applications, and data from unauthorized access, exploitation, and attacks
    - **Key Domains:**
      - **Network Security** - Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs, DDoS protection
      - **Application Security** - Secure coding, input validation, authentication/authorization
      - **Identity & Access** - Authentication, authorization, MFA, privilege management
      - **Data Protection** - Encryption, access controls, data classification
      - **Infrastructure** - Patching, hardening, vulnerability management
      - **Monitoring & Detection** - SIEM, EDR, incident response
    - **Approach:** Defense-in-depth with multiple layers of security controls
    - **Mindset:** "How do we prevent this?" - Proactive and continuous
    - **Relationship to Offensive Security:**
      - Blue Team builds and maintains defenses
      - Red Team tests those defenses
      - Continuous improvement cycle: Test → Find → Fix → Test
    - **For Fintech:**
      - Prevent fraud and unauthorized access
      - Protect customer PII and financial data
      - Ensure system availability and integrity
      - Meet regulatory compliance (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 2)
  - **🔒 [OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)](../../explanation/information-security/ex-in-se__owasp.md)**
    - **What OWASP Is:**
      - Nonprofit foundation dedicated to improving application security
      - Community-driven, vendor-neutral organization (founded 2001)
      - Provides free, open-source security resources and tools
      - Global network of security professionals collaborating on security standards
    - **Core Mission:** Make application security visible so organizations can make informed decisions about security risks
    - **Core Values:** Openness, Community, Innovation, Pragmatism
    - **Key Projects:**
      - **OWASP Top 10** - Industry standard for 10 most critical web app security risks
      - **OWASP ZAP** - Open-source dynamic security testing tool
      - **API Security Top 10** - Critical risks specific to APIs (essential for fintech)
      - **SAMM** - Software Assurance Maturity Model for secure development
      - **WSTG** - Web Security Testing Guide (comprehensive testing methodology)
      - **Dependency-Check** - Scans for vulnerable dependencies (supply chain security)
    - **OWASP Top 10 2025 (Latest Edition):**
      - **A01:2025 - Broken Access Control** - Users accessing resources or performing actions they shouldn't be permitted to; privilege escalation and authorization bypass
      - **A02:2025 - Cryptographic Failures** - Sensitive data exposed due to weak or missing encryption; failures in protecting data at rest and in transit
      - **A03:2025 - Software Supply Chain Failures (NEW)** - Vulnerabilities in dependencies, third-party libraries, and integrated services; critical for fintech payment systems
      - **A04:2025 - Injection** - Untrusted data injected into interpreters (SQL, LDAP, OS commands); allows attackers to execute malicious code or access unauthorized data
      - **A05:2025 - Insecure Design** - Missing security controls in architecture and design phase; indicates threats not addressed at design time
      - **A06:2025 - Security Misconfiguration** - Insecure default settings, incomplete configurations, exposed admin panels, unnecessary services enabled
      - **A07:2025 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components** - Using libraries and frameworks with known vulnerabilities; failure to track and update dependencies
      - **A08:2025 - Identification and Authentication Failures** - Weak password policies, credential stuffing, brute force attacks, session management flaws
      - **A09:2025 - Software and Data Integrity Failures** - Code or infrastructure not verified; CI/CD pipeline compromises, insecure updates, tampered data
      - **A10:2025 - Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions (NEW)** - Error messages exposing sensitive information, improper exception handling revealing system details
    - **Why OWASP Matters for Fintech:**
      - Industry standard for web application security (widely referenced)
      - API Security Top 10 critical for payment processing and integrations
      - Supply Chain Failures directly relevant (payment gateways, third-party services)
      - Regulatory alignment: PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 2 all reference OWASP
