  - **🔒 Security Testing: SAST vs DAST - [SAST](../../explanation/information-security/ex-in-se__sast.md) | [DAST](../../explanation/information-security/ex-in-se__dast.md)**
    - **What is SAST (Static Application Security Testing)?**
      - Security testing approach that analyzes source code, bytecode, or binaries **without executing** the application
      - Often called "white-box testing" because it has full visibility into the codebase
      - Key characteristics:
        - Scans code during development phase (shift-left approach)
        - Identifies vulnerabilities early in SDLC
        - No need for running application
        - Can detect issues like:
          - SQL injection vulnerabilities
          - Buffer overflows
          - Hard-coded credentials
          - Insecure cryptographic practices
      - ✅ Advantages:
        - Early detection (cheaper to fix)
        - Can scan entire codebase
        - Provides specific line numbers and code snippets
        - Fast feedback during development
      - ❌ Disadvantages:
        - May produce false positives
        - Cannot detect runtime or configuration issues
        - Language/framework specific tools needed
    - ### What is DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)?
      - Security testing approach that analyzes **running applications** from the outside
      - Often called "black-box testing" because it tests without knowledge of internal structure
      - Key characteristics:
        - Tests application in runtime environment
        - Simulates real-world attacks
        - Technology agnostic (doesn't need source code)
        - Can detect issues like:
          - Authentication/authorization flaws
          - Server configuration issues
          - Session management vulnerabilities
          - XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities
      - ✅ Advantages:
        - Finds runtime vulnerabilities
        - Tests actual deployed configuration
        - No false positives from code analysis
        - Language/framework independent
      - ❌ Disadvantages:
        - Later in SDLC (more expensive to fix)
        - May not achieve full code coverage
        - Requires running environment
        - Slower execution time
    - ### SAST vs DAST: Key Differences
      - **Testing Phase:**
        - SAST: During development (pre-deployment)
        - DAST: During/after deployment
      - **Code Access:**
        - SAST: Requires source code access
        - DAST: No source code needed
      - **Coverage:**
        - SAST: Can analyze all code paths
        - DAST: Limited to executed paths
      - **Speed:**
        - SAST: Fast, automated scanning
        - DAST: Slower, requires running app
      - **Best Practice:** Use both approaches (SAST + DAST) for comprehensive security coverage
    - ### Relevance to Open Sharia Enterprise
      - As a fintech application, we should implement both:
        - SAST tools in CI/CD pipeline for early detection
        - DAST tools in staging/pre-production environments
        - Regular security audits using both approaches
      - Consider tools like:
        - SAST: SonarQube, Semgrep, ESLint security plugins
        - DAST: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
