# How to Add a Programming Language

**Step-by-step guide for adding a new programming language to ayokoding-web following the Programming Language Content Standard.**

This guide walks you through the complete process of adding a new programming language (e.g., Kotlin, TypeScript, Rust, Clojure) to ayokoding-web. Follow these steps to ensure your content meets quality standards and integrates seamlessly with existing content.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Deep expertise** in the target language (5+ years experience recommended)
- [ ] **Access to repository** with write permissions to `apps/ayokoding-web/`
- [ ] **Familiarity with conventions**:
  - [Programming Language Content Standard](../../governance/conventions/tutorial/programming-language-content.md)
  - [Hugo Content Convention - ayokoding](../../governance/conventions/hugo/ayokoding.md)
  - [Content Quality Principles](../../governance/conventions/content/quality.md)
- [ ] **AI agents available**:
  - `ayokoding-web-general-maker` (general content creation)
  - `ayokoding-web-by-example-maker` (by-example tutorial creation)
  - `ayokoding-web-general-checker` (general quality validation)
  - `ayokoding-web-by-example-checker` (by-example tutorial validation)
  - `ayokoding-web-facts-checker` (factual verification)
  - `ayokoding-web-link-checker` (link validation)
- [ ] **Reference implementations** studied (review Golang, Python, or Java content)

**Time Investment:** Adding a complete programming language requires creating 12,000-15,000 lines of high-quality content. Plan accordingly.

## Phase 1: Planning

### Step 1.1: Choose Language and Validate Demand

**Why:** Ensure the language addition provides value to ayokoding-web users.

**Actions:**

1. **Identify the language**: Kotlin, TypeScript, Rust, Clojure, etc.
2. **Validate demand**: Check if there's user interest (surveys, requests, market research)
3. **Assess uniqueness**: What does this language offer that existing languages don't?
4. **Determine paradigm fit**: How does it compare to existing languages?
   - Golang: Concurrent, compiled, simple
   - Python: Dynamic, multi-paradigm, beginner-friendly
   - Java: OOP, strongly-typed, enterprise
   - **Your language**: [Define key characteristics]

**Deliverable:** Brief justification document (can be internal notes)

### Step 1.2: Select Reference Implementation

**Why:** Leverage existing structure to accelerate content creation.

**Actions:**

1. **Choose closest match** from benchmark languages:
   - **Golang**: If your language emphasizes concurrency, compiled performance, or simplicity
   - **Python**: If your language is dynamic, multi-paradigm, or beginner-friendly
   - **Java**: If your language emphasizes OOP, strong typing, or enterprise patterns
2. **Note structural similarities**: What concepts map directly?
3. **Identify unique aspects**: What topics are language-specific?

**Deliverable:** Reference language choice and customization notes

### Step 1.3: Plan Content Scope

**Why:** Define what "done" means before starting.

**Actions:**

1. **Decide on completeness level**:
   - **Full implementation**: All 5 tutorials + 15 how-to guides + cookbook (recommended)
   - **Minimum viable**: Initial Setup + Quick Start + Beginner + 8 how-to guides + cookbook
2. **Map coverage levels** to language complexity:
   - What goes in 0-5% (Installation)?
   - What goes in 5-30% (Touchpoints)?
   - What goes in 0-60% (Fundamentals)?
   - What goes in 60-85% (Production)?
   - What goes in 85-95% (Expert)?
3. **Identify how-to topics** (12-18 language-specific problems)
4. **Plan cookbook categories** (30+ recipes)

**Deliverable:** Content outline with topics mapped to coverage levels

## Phase 2: Setup

### Step 2.1: Create Directory Structure

**Why:** Establish the foundation for all content.

**Actions:**

1. Navigate to ayokoding-web content directory:

   ```bash
   cd apps/ayokoding-web/content/en/learn/swe/prog-lang/
   ```

2. Create language directory (use lowercase, no special characters):

   ```bash
   mkdir [language-name]  # e.g., kotlin, typescript, rust
   cd [language-name]
   ```

3. Create standard subdirectories:

   ```bash
   mkdir tutorials how-to explanation reference
   ```

4. Create tutorial files:

   ```bash
   touch tutorials/_index.md
   touch tutorials/overview.md
   touch tutorials/initial-setup.md
   touch tutorials/quick-start.md
   touch tutorials/beginner.md
   touch tutorials/intermediate.md
   touch tutorials/advanced.md
   ```

5. Create how-to files:

   ```bash
   touch how-to/_index.md
   touch how-to/overview.md
   touch how-to/cookbook.md
   # Add 12-18 specific how-to guides based on your plan
   ```

6. Create explanation files:

   ```bash
   touch explanation/_index.md
   touch explanation/overview.md
   touch explanation/best-practices.md
   touch explanation/anti-patterns.md
   ```

7. Create reference files:

   ```bash
   touch reference/_index.md
   touch reference/overview.md
   ```

8. Create main index and overview:

   ```bash
   cd ..  # Back to [language-name]/ directory
   touch _index.md
   touch overview.md
   ```

**Deliverable:** Complete directory structure with empty files

### Step 2.2: Set Up Navigation Files

**Why:** Enable Hugo navigation and establish content hierarchy.

**Actions:**

1. **Create `_index.md` (navigation hub)**:

   ```yaml
   ---
   title: [Language Name]  # e.g., "Kotlin"
   date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS+07:00
   draft: false
   description: Complete learning path from installation to expert mastery - organized using the Diátaxis framework
   weight: 10002  # Level 5 (represents the language folder)
   type: docs
   layout: list
   ---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** ayokoding-web-general-checker reports Hugo convention violations

**Solution:** Review [Hugo Content Convention - ayokoding](../../governance/conventions/hugo/ayokoding.md) and fix violations. Common issues:

- Missing frontmatter fields
- Incorrect weight values (use level-based system with correct levels)
- Wrong link format (use absolute paths with language prefix)

**Weight System Quick Reference:**

- **Programming language folder** (e.g., `/golang/`) is at **level 5**
  - Folder's `_index.md`: weight **10002** (level 5 - represents the folder)
- **Content inside language folder** (`overview.md`, category folders) is at **level 6**
  - `overview.md`: weight **100000** (level 6 base)
  - `tutorials/` folder's `_index.md`: weight **100002** (level 6 - represents the folder)
  - Other category folders: **100003**, **100004**, **100005**...
- **Content inside category folders** (tutorial files, how-to files) is at **level 7**
  - Use base **1000000** (resets per parent category)
  - `tutorials/overview.md`: **1000000** (level 7)
  - `how-to/overview.md`: **1000000** (RESET - different parent)

**Issue:** ayokoding-web-facts-checker reports ❌ Error or 📅 Outdated

**Solution:** Update technical claims with current information:

- Check official language documentation
- Verify version numbers
- Test code examples with latest version
- Update external references

**Issue:** Code examples don't run

**Solution:**

- Test examples in fresh environment
- Include all necessary imports/dependencies
- Verify syntax for target language version
- Add prerequisites section if needed

**Issue:** Content feels inconsistent with other languages

**Solution:** Review benchmark implementations (Golang, Python, Java):

- Check structure alignment
- Verify pedagogical patterns match
- Ensure similar depth/breadth
- Maintain voice and tone consistency
