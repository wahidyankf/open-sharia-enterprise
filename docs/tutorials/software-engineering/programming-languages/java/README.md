  - **Prerequisites**: Complete the Beginner tutorial
  - String operations, collection patterns, concurrency recipes, error handling, design patterns, REST APIs

## 🎯 How to Choose Your Starting Point

**Choose based on your experience level:**

| Experience Level                        | Recommended Path                                                   | Duration         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| **No programming experience**           | Initial Setup → Quick Start → Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced   | 22-32 hours      |
| **Experienced programmer, new to Java** | Quick Start → Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced                   | 14-26 hours      |
| **Familiar with some Java, want depth** | Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced                                 | 13-24 hours      |
| **Building production systems now**     | Intermediate → Advanced (reference Quick Start/Beginner as needed) | 10-20 hours      |
| **Seeking expert mastery**              | Advanced (assume Intermediate knowledge)                           | 6-12 hours       |
| **Need a specific pattern?**            | Cookbook (reference relevant tutorials as needed)                  | 30 min - 2 hours |
