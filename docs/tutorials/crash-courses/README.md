# Crash Courses

Quick-start guides designed to get you productive with a new language or technology in the shortest time possible.

## 🎯 Purpose

Crash courses provide:

- **Rapid learning** - Core concepts in minimal time
- **Hands-on examples** - Practical code you can run immediately
- **Essential knowledge** - The 20% that covers 80% of use cases
- **Structured progression** - Concepts build on each other logically

## 📚 Available Crash Courses

### Programming Languages

- [**Golang Crash Course**](./tu-crco__golang.md) - Modern systems programming language with built-in concurrency

## 🎓 How to Use These Courses

1. **Prerequisites** - Check each course for required background knowledge
2. **Hands-on practice** - Type out examples, don't just read
3. **Experiment** - Modify examples to test your understanding
4. **Continue to cookbooks** - After completing a crash course, check the [Cookbooks](../cookbooks/README.md) for practical patterns
5. **Build something** - Apply concepts in a small project

## 🗺️ Course Structure

Each crash course follows this structure:

- **Introduction** - What, why, and when to use the technology
- **Setup** - Installation and development environment
- **Core Language Features** - Syntax, types, control flow, data structures
- **Language Mechanics** - Functions, methods, interfaces, error handling, concurrency primitives
- **Basic Examples** - Simple code to understand each feature
- **Next Steps** - Where to go for practical patterns (cookbooks) and deeper learning
