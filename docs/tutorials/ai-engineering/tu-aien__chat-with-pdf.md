# 🤖 Chat with PDF: How It Works

Learn how PDF chat applications work under the hood, from document processing to generating answers.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- The complete architecture of a PDF chat system
- How documents are processed and chunked
- How embeddings and vector databases work
- The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern
- How to handle different types of questions

## 📚 Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of APIs and HTTP requests
- Familiarity with databases (SQL or NoSQL)
- Basic knowledge of LLMs (Large Language Models)
