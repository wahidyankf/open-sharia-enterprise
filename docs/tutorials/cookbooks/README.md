# Cookbooks

**Learning-oriented guides with practical recipes and patterns** for solving real-world programming problems through working examples.

## 📖 What are Cookbooks?

Cookbooks are collections of **practical recipes** that teach you how to apply programming concepts to real-world problems. Each recipe:

- ✅ **Shows working code** - Complete, runnable examples
- ✅ **Explains the pattern** - Why and when to use it
- ✅ **Teaches by doing** - Learn through practical application
- ✅ **Builds on fundamentals** - Assumes you've completed the relevant crash course

**Cookbooks vs Crash Courses:**

| Crash Courses             | Cookbooks                  |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Learn the language syntax | Learn to solve problems    |
| Core fundamentals         | Practical patterns         |
| "What is X?"              | "How do I use X?"          |
| 30-60 minute overview     | In-depth recipes           |
| Start here first          | Go here after crash course |

## 🍳 Available Cookbooks

### Programming Languages

- **[Golang Cookbook](./tu-co__golang.md)** - Practical Go patterns including generics, concurrency patterns, error handling strategies, file embedding, testing patterns, and design patterns

## 🎯 How to Use Cookbooks

1. **Complete the crash course first** - Cookbooks assume you understand the fundamentals
2. **Pick a recipe** - Find a pattern or problem you want to learn
3. **Study the example** - Read through the complete code
4. **Try it yourself** - Modify and experiment with the pattern
5. **Apply to your project** - Adapt the recipe to your needs

## 📚 Cookbook Structure

Each cookbook typically contains:

- **Prerequisites** - What you should know before starting
- **Recipes by category** - Organized by problem domain
- **Complete examples** - Working code you can run
- **Explanations** - Why the pattern works
- **Variations** - Different approaches to the same problem
- **Best practices** - Tips and gotchas

## 🔗 Related Resources

- **[How-To Guides](../../how-to/README.md)** - Step-by-step solutions to specific problems
- **[Reference Documentation](../../reference/README.md)** - Technical specifications and API docs
- **[Explanations](../../explanation/README.md)** - Deep conceptual understanding

## 🌟 Contributing

Want to add a new cookbook or recipe? Cookbooks should:

- Focus on practical, real-world patterns
- Include complete, runnable code examples
- Explain why the pattern works, not just how
- Build on crash course knowledge
- Follow the [Diátaxis framework](../../explanation/conventions/ex-co__diataxis-framework.md) for learning-oriented content
