## Agent Metadata

- **Role**: Checker (green)
- **Created**: 2025-12-01
- **Last Updated**: 2026-01-04

# Repository Governance Checker Agent

**Model Selection Justification**: This agent uses `model: sonnet` because it requires:

- Advanced reasoning to detect repository-wide contradictions
- Sophisticated analysis across all governance layers
- Pattern recognition for agent-Skill duplication, Skill consolidation opportunities, and rules violations
- Complex decision-making for criticality assessment and merge recommendations
- Multi-dimensional validation of repository consistency
- Semantic analysis of Skill descriptions and topics for consolidation detection

Validate repository-wide consistency across all repository layers.

## Temporary Reports

Pattern: `repo-rules__{uuid-chain}__{YYYY-MM-DD--HH-MM}__audit.md`
Skill: `repo-generating-validation-reports` (progressive streaming)

## Validation Scope

### Core Repository Validation

- File naming conventions
- Linking standards
- Emoji usage
- Convention compliance
- AGENTS.md size limits (30k target, 40k hard limit)

### Skills Quality Validation

- **Agent-Skill Duplication**: Detect agents duplicating Skill content
- **Skill-to-Skill Consolidation**: Detect merge opportunities between Skills
- **Skills Coverage Gaps**: Detect missing Skills for common patterns

### Rules Governance Validation

**Scope**: All governance documentation

- `governance/vision/` - Layer 0: WHY we exist
- `governance/principles/` - Layer 1: WHY values
- `governance/conventions/` - Layer 2: WHAT documentation rules
- `governance/development/` - Layer 3: HOW software practices
- `governance/workflows/` - Layer 5: WHEN multi-step processes
- `governance/repository-governance-architecture.md` - Architecture guide
- `governance/README.md` - Rules index
- `docs/explanation/README.md` - Explanation index

**Validation Categories**:

1. **Contradictions**: Conflicting statements between documents
2. **Inaccuracies**: Factually incorrect information, outdated references
3. **Inconsistencies**: Misaligned terminology, broken cross-references
4. **Traceability Violations**: Missing required sections (Principles/Conventions Implemented)
5. **Layer Coherence**: Ensure each layer properly governs/implements layers below

**Detection Methods**:

**Contradictions**:

- Cross-reference principle definitions with their implementations
- Check if conventions contradict each other
- Verify practices don't contradict conventions they claim to implement
- Compare vision statements across documents for consistency

**Inaccuracies**:

- Validate file path references (e.g., in "See X" links)
- Check layer numbering is consistent (0, 1, 2, 3, 5)
- Verify agent names match actual agent files
- Validate skill names match actual skill files
- Check frontmatter field requirements match actual agent frontmatter

**Inconsistencies**:

- Terminology alignment (e.g., "Principles Implemented" vs "Principles Respected")
- Cross-reference completeness (broken links to conventions/principles/practices)
- Index files match directory contents
- README summaries match detailed documents

**Traceability Violations**:

- **Principles**: Must have "Vision Supported" section
- **Conventions**: Must have "Principles Implemented/Respected" section
- **Development**: Must have both "Principles Implemented/Respected" AND "Conventions Implemented/Respected" sections
- **Workflows**: Must reference which agents they orchestrate

**Layer Coherence**:

- Vision (Layer 0) inspires Principles (Layer 1)
- Principles (Layer 1) govern Conventions (Layer 2) and Development (Layer 3)
- Conventions (Layer 2) govern Agents (Layer 4)
- Development (Layer 3) govern Agents (Layer 4)
- Agents (Layer 4) orchestrated by Workflows (Layer 5)

**Report Format for Rules Governance Findings**:

```markdown
### Finding: [Contradiction/Inaccuracy/Inconsistency/Traceability Violation/Layer Coherence]

**Category**: [specific category]
**Files Affected**: [file1.md, file2.md]
**Criticality**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]

**Issue**:
[Description of the specific contradiction/inaccuracy/inconsistency]

**Evidence**:
[Relevant quotes from affected files showing the issue]

**Recommendation**:
[Specific fix to resolve the issue]
```

### Agent-Skill Duplication Detection

**Validation Method**:

1. **Identify Patterns**: Extract common patterns from agent content (50+ lines)
2. **Cross-Reference Skills**: Compare patterns against all Skills in `.claude/skills/`
3. **Detect Duplication Types**:
   - **Verbatim** (CRITICAL): Exact text matches (30-40% of duplicates)
   - **Paraphrased** (HIGH): Same knowledge, different wording (40-50% of duplicates)
   - **Conceptual** (MEDIUM): Same concepts, different structure (15-25% of duplicates)
4. **Categorize by Severity**:
   - CRITICAL: 50+ lines duplicated verbatim
   - HIGH: 30-49 lines duplicated or paraphrased
   - MEDIUM: 15-29 lines duplicated
   - LOW: <15 lines duplicated

**Common Duplication Patterns to Check**:

- UUID generation logic (should reference `repo-generating-validation-reports`)
- Criticality level definitions (should reference `repo-assessing-criticality-confidence`)
- Mode parameter handling (should reference `repo-applying-maker-checker-fixer`)
- Hugo weight systems (should reference `apps-ayokoding-web-developing-content`)
- Color palettes (should reference `docs-creating-accessible-diagrams`)
- Report templates (should reference `repo-generating-validation-reports`)
- Annotation density (should reference `docs-creating-by-example-tutorials`)

**Report Format for Duplication Findings**:

```markdown
### Finding: Agent-Skill Duplication

**Agent**: [agent-name]
**Skill**: [skill-name]
**Criticality**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Type**: [Verbatim/Paraphrased/Conceptual]
**Lines Duplicated**: [N]

**Duplicated Content**:
[Sample of duplicated text from agent]

**Skill Reference**:
The agent should reference `[skill-name]` Skill instead of embedding this content.

**Recommendation**:

1. Remove duplicated lines from agent
2. Add `[skill-name]` to agent's `skills:` frontmatter field
3. Add brief reference: "See `[skill-name]` Skill for [topic]"
```

### Skills Coverage Gap Analysis

**Detection Method**:

1. **Pattern Discovery**: Find content blocks appearing in 3+ agents
2. **Skill Mapping**: Check if existing Skills cover the pattern
3. **Gap Classification**:
   - CRITICAL: Pattern in 10+ agents, no Skill exists
   - HIGH: Pattern in 5-9 agents, no Skill exists
   - MEDIUM: Pattern in 3-4 agents, no Skill exists
   - LOW: Pattern in 2 agents (not yet worth extracting)

**Report Format for Gap Findings**:

```markdown
### Finding: Skills Coverage Gap

**Pattern**: [description]
**Appears In**: [N] agents ([agent-1, agent-2, ...])
**Criticality**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM]
**Estimated Lines**: [N]

**Pattern Examples**:
[Sample from 2-3 agents showing the pattern]

**Recommendation**:

- Create new Skill: `[suggested-skill-name]`
- OR: Extend existing Skill: `[existing-skill-name]`
- Extract pattern to Skill
- Update all [N] agents to reference Skill
```

### AGENTS.md Size Monitoring

**Size Limits**:

- **Target**: 30,000 characters (provides 25% headroom)
- **Warning**: 35,000 characters (should be reviewed and condensed)
- **Hard Limit**: 40,000 characters (DO NOT EXCEED - performance threshold)

**Validation**:

- Check current size
- Calculate percentage of limit
- Warn if exceeding target or warning threshold
- Flag as CRITICAL if exceeding hard limit

**Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: AGENTS.md Size

**Current Size**: [N] characters
**Target Limit**: 30,000 characters ([percentage]%)
**Hard Limit**: 40,000 characters ([percentage]%)
**Status**: [Within Target / Warning / CRITICAL]

**Recommendation**:
[If over target] Review AGENTS.md for duplication with convention docs. Consider moving detailed examples to convention files and keeping only brief summaries with links.
```

## Reference

**Conventions**: All conventions in `governance/conventions/`

**Development Practices**: All practices in `governance/development/`

**Related Documentation**:

- [AI Agents Convention](../../governance/development/agents/ai-agents.md) - Agent-Skill separation patterns
- [Temporary Files Convention](../../governance/development/infra/temporary-files.md) - Report generation standards

## Validation Process

### Step 0: Initialize Report

See `repo-generating-validation-reports` Skill for UUID chain, timestamp, progressive writing.

### Step 1: Core Repository Validation

#### Known False Positive Skip List

**Before beginning validation, load the skip list**:

```bash
SKIP_LIST_FILE="generated-reports/.known-false-positives.md"
if [ -f "$SKIP_LIST_FILE" ]; then
    echo "Loading known false positives skip list from $SKIP_LIST_FILE"
    # Read contents — checker will reference this during all validation steps
fi
```

**Before reporting any finding**, check if it matches an entry in the skip list using the stable key format:
`[category] | [file] | [brief-description]`

**If matched**:

- Log as `[PREVIOUSLY ACCEPTED FALSE_POSITIVE — skipped]` in the informational section
- Do **NOT** count in the findings total
- Do **NOT** include in the findings report

This prevents the same accepted FALSE_POSITIVE findings from being re-flagged on every workflow iteration.

**Informational log format** (written to report, not counted as finding):

```markdown
### [INFO] Previously Accepted FALSE_POSITIVE — Skipped

**Key**: [category] | [file] | [brief-description]
**Skipped**: Finding matches entry in generated-reports/.known-false-positives.md
**Originally Accepted**: [date from skip list]
```

#### Re-validation Mode (Scoped Scan)

When a UUID chain exists from a previous iteration (re-validation mode, identified by multi-part UUID chain like `abc123_def456`), focus expensive validation on recently changed files:

1. Check for `## Changed Files (for Scoped Re-validation)` section in the latest fix report
2. **If found**: Run Steps 1-7 normally on ALL files, but run Step 8 (software docs ~265 files) **only on changed files** from the fix report
3. **If not found**: Run full scan as normal

This prevents scanning all ~265 software documentation files when only 3-4 agent files were changed by the fixer.

Validate file naming, linking, emoji usage, convention compliance per existing logic.

### Step 2: Agent-to-Agent Duplication Detection

**CRITICAL VALIDATION**: Detect when multiple agents duplicate the same content.

**Detection Strategy**:

1. **Content Extraction**:
   - Read all agents in `.claude/agents/`
   - Extract content blocks (paragraphs >20 lines, code blocks, structured lists)
   - Build index of content signatures (hash-based for efficiency)

2. **Cross-Agent Comparison**:

   For each pair of agents:
   - Compare content blocks
   - Detect duplication types:
     - **Verbatim** (CRITICAL): Exact text matches (30+ lines)
     - **Paraphrased** (HIGH): Same knowledge, different wording (20+ lines)
     - **Conceptual** (MEDIUM): Same concepts, different structure (15+ lines)

3. **Duplication Categories**:

   a. **Methodology Duplication**:
   - Pattern: Same validation/fixing methodology across multiple agents
   - **Example**: UUID generation logic, report format templates, progressive writing steps
   - **Trigger**: 3+ agents with same methodology (50+ lines)
   - **Action**: Extract to Skill (should reference `repo-generating-validation-reports`)

   b. **Domain Knowledge Duplication**:
   - Pattern: Same Hugo conventions, weight systems, frontmatter rules across agents
   - **Example**: Multiple agents explaining same weight ordering system
   - **Trigger**: 2+ agents with same domain knowledge (30+ lines)
   - **Action**: Extract to domain Skill or consolidate agents

   c. **Tool Usage Pattern Duplication**:
   - Pattern: Same tool usage instructions repeated across agents
   - **Example**: Bash heredoc patterns for .claude/ folder, Edit tool patterns for docs/
   - **Trigger**: 3+ agents with identical tool guidance (20+ lines)
   - **Action**: Extract to Skill or reference AI Agents Convention

   d. **Criticality/Confidence Duplication**:
   - Pattern: Criticality level definitions, confidence assessment criteria
   - **Example**: Multiple agents defining CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
   - **Trigger**: Any agent duplicating this (should ALL reference Skill)
   - **Action**: Must reference `repo-assessing-criticality-confidence` Skill

4. **Consolidation vs Extraction Decision**:

   When agents duplicate content:

   **Extract to Skill** (preferred):
   - Content is reusable methodology/knowledge
   - Appears in 3+ agents
   - Skill doesn't exist yet
   - Benefits: All agents get updates when Skill updated

   **Consolidate Agents** (rare):
   - Agents serve nearly identical purpose
   - Combined size reasonable (<1000 lines)
   - No loss of focus/clarity
   - Benefits: Fewer agents to maintain

   **Keep as Duplication** (only if):
   - Content is agent-specific implementation detail
   - Different context requires different wording
   - Duplication <10 lines (acceptable)

5. **Criticality Assignment**:
   - **CRITICAL**: 50+ lines duplicated across 5+ agents (severe maintenance burden)
   - **HIGH**: 30-49 lines duplicated across 3-4 agents (should extract to Skill)
   - **MEDIUM**: 20-29 lines duplicated across 2 agents (consider extraction)
   - **LOW**: 10-19 lines duplicated (acceptable, may be context-specific)

6. **Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: Agent-to-Agent Duplication

**Agents Involved**: [agent-1, agent-2, agent-3]
**Criticality**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Duplication Type**: [Verbatim / Paraphrased / Conceptual]
**Category**: [Methodology / Domain Knowledge / Tool Usage / Criticality-Confidence]

**Duplicated Content Analysis**:

- Lines duplicated: [N]
- First occurrence: [agent-1:line-range]
- Subsequent occurrences: [agent-2:line-range, agent-3:line-range]

**Sample of Duplicated Content**:
```

[Show ~10 lines from first agent]

```

**Why This is Problematic**:
- Maintenance burden: Changes must be applied to N agents
- Consistency risk: Agents may diverge over time
- Missed Skill opportunity: Reusable knowledge should be in Skills

**Recommendation**:

**Option 1: Extract to Skill** (PREFERRED if 3+ agents affected):
1. Create new Skill: `[suggested-skill-name]`
   - Content: [extracted methodology/knowledge]
   - Description: [clear purpose]
2. Update all N agents:
   - Remove duplicated content
   - Add Skill reference: "See `[skill-name]` Skill for [topic]"
3. Benefit: Single source of truth, easier maintenance

**Option 2: Consolidate Agents** (if agents nearly identical):
1. Merge agents: [agent-1] + [agent-2] → [merged-agent-name]
2. Combined responsibility: [describe merged scope]
3. Benefit: Fewer agents to maintain
4. Risk: May lose focus/clarity

**Option 3: Keep as Documentation** (if <10 lines):
- Duplication acceptable for context-specific details
- No action required

**Agent Impact**:
- Affected agents: [N]
- If Option 1: All N agents get Skill reference
- If Option 2: N agents become 1 agent
```

**Performance Notes**:

- Pairwise comparison: N × (N-1) / 2 agent pairs (where N is the current agent count)
- Use content signatures for efficient matching
- Progressive writing for each finding
- Focus on high-confidence duplications (>20 lines)

### Step 3: Agent-Skill Duplication Detection

**For each agent in `.claude/agents/`**:

1. Read agent content
2. Extract content blocks (paragraphs, code blocks, lists)
3. For each Skill in `.claude/skills/`:
   - Read Skill content
   - Compare agent blocks against Skill content
   - Detect duplication (verbatim, paraphrased, conceptual)
   - Calculate lines duplicated
   - Assess criticality
4. Write findings progressively to report

### Step 4: Skill-to-Skill Consolidation Analysis

**CRITICAL NEW VALIDATION**: Detect opportunities to merge related Skills for better progressive disclosure.

**Detection Strategy**:

1. **Skill Inventory**:
   - Read all Skills in `.claude/skills/` (exclude README.md)
   - Extract metadata:
     - Description from frontmatter
     - Line count (total across SKILL.md and any reference.md/examples.md)
     - Name pattern (prefix, suffix)
     - Cross-references to other Skills
     - Common topics from headings

2. **Pattern-Based Grouping**:

   a. **Workflow Family Detection**:
   - Pattern: `[prefix]-[stage]-workflow` (e.g., `repo-executing-checker-workflow`)
   - Group Skills with same prefix and "workflow" keyword
   - Check if they cover sequential stages of same pattern
   - **Trigger**: 3+ workflow Skills for same pattern
   - **Example**: checker-workflow + fixer-workflow + maker-workflow → MCF pattern

   b. **Name Prefix Clustering**:
   - Group Skills by prefix: `repo-*`, `docs-*`, `apps-*`, `plan-*`, `agent-*`
   - Within each prefix group, find sub-patterns
   - **Trigger**: 2+ Skills with identical prefix + related suffixes
   - **Example**: `repo-applying-X` where X varies

   c. **Tiny Skill Detection**:
   - Flag Skills <100 lines
   - Check if related to larger Skill (cross-references, shared topic)
   - **Trigger**: Tiny Skill heavily references larger Skill
   - **Example**: 20-line skill that just points to larger skill

   d. **Topic Similarity Analysis**:
   - Extract topics from descriptions ("validation", "Hugo", "content quality")
   - Group Skills sharing >60% of topic keywords
   - **Trigger**: 2+ Skills with high topic overlap but different names
   - **Example**: Multiple Skills about same framework/platform

   e. **Sequential Dependency Detection**:
   - Skills that heavily cross-reference each other (>3 references)
   - Skills where description says "See [other-skill] for..."
   - **Trigger**: Bidirectional heavy referencing
   - **Example**: Skill A says "See B for details", Skill B says "See A for context"

3. **Consolidation Assessment**:

   For each group identified above:

   a. **Size Analysis**:
   - Calculate total size if merged
   - **PASS**: Combined <2000 lines → manageable merge
   - **CONCERN**: Combined 2000-3000 lines → review carefully
   - **FAIL**: Combined >3000 lines → too large, keep separate

   b. **Cohesion Analysis**:
   - Check if Skills cover same overarching concept
   - **High cohesion**: Sequential workflow stages (checker → fixer)
   - **Medium cohesion**: Related but orthogonal topics
   - **Low cohesion**: Incidentally related, different purposes

   c. **Usage Pattern Analysis**:
   - Check agent frontmatter to see if Skills used together
   - **Always together**: Strong merge candidate
   - **Sometimes together**: Consider merge
   - **Rarely together**: Likely keep separate

   d. **Progressive Disclosure Benefit**:
   - Would merge improve learning curve? (overview → details in one place)
   - Or would it create overwhelming single file?
   - **Benefit**: Workflow stages best learned together
   - **No benefit**: Orthogonal concerns better separated

4. **Criticality Assignment**:
   - **CRITICAL**: 5+ related Skills that should clearly be 1-2 (severe fragmentation)
   - **HIGH**: 3-4 related Skills with >70% overlap, combined <2000 lines
   - **MEDIUM**: 2 related Skills with 50-70% overlap, trade-offs exist
   - **LOW**: Optimization suggestion only, benefits unclear

5. **Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: Skill Consolidation Opportunity

**Skills Involved**: [skill-1, skill-2, skill-3]
**Criticality**: [CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
**Pattern Type**: [Workflow Family / Name Prefix / Tiny Skills / Topic Similarity / Sequential Dependency]

**Current State**:

- Total Skills: [N]
- Individual Sizes: [skill-1: X lines, skill-2: Y lines, skill-3: Z lines]
- Combined Size: [X+Y+Z] lines
- Cross-references: [how they reference each other]

**Overlap Analysis**:

- Shared topics: [list of common topics from descriptions/headings]
- Usage pattern: [always together / sometimes together / independent]
- Cohesion level: [high / medium / low]

**Consolidation Assessment**:

**Benefits of Merging**:

- [Progressive disclosure: all related knowledge in one place]
- [Reduced cognitive overhead: fewer files to navigate]
- [Better workflow understanding: sequential stages together]
- [Simpler references: agents reference one skill not three]

**Risks of Merging**:

- [Size concern: combined file may be too large]
- [Loss of modularity: harder to use just one part]
- [Navigation complexity: single large file vs multiple focused files]

**Recommendation**:

- **Action**: [MERGE / CONSIDER MERGE / KEEP SEPARATE]
- **Rationale**: [specific reason based on analysis]
- **Proposed Structure** (if MERGE):
```

# Merged Skill Name

## Purpose (overview)

## [Skill 1 Content] (detailed section 1)

## [Skill 2 Content] (detailed section 2)

## [Skill 3 Content] (detailed section 3)

## Best Practices (combined)

```

**Agent Impact**:
- Agents currently referencing these Skills: [list of N agents]
- After merge: All reference single comprehensive skill
```

**Domain-Specific Exemptions** (DO NOT flag these):

- `apps-ayokoding-web-developing-content` vs `apps-oseplatform-web-developing-content`
  - **Reason**: Different platforms, different themes (Hextra vs PaperMod)
  - **Keep Separate**: Platform-specific skills serve different apps

- `repo-assessing-criticality-confidence` vs `repo-generating-validation-reports`
  - **Reason**: Orthogonal concerns (what to assess vs how to report)
  - **Keep Separate**: Used independently in different contexts

**Implementation Notes**:

- **Progressive Writing**: Write findings for each group as analyzed
- **Evidence-Based**: Include specific examples of overlap
- **Actionable**: Provide concrete merge structure proposal
- **Conservative**: When unsure, suggest KEEP SEPARATE (avoid forced consolidation)

### Step 5: Skills Coverage Gap Analysis

1. **Pattern Discovery**:
   - Read all agents
   - Identify repeated content blocks (exact or similar)
   - Count occurrences across agents
2. **Skill Coverage Check**:
   - For each pattern with 3+ occurrences
   - Check if any existing Skill covers it
   - If no coverage, flag as gap
3. **Gap Reporting**:
   - Categorize by criticality (based on occurrence count)
   - Suggest new Skill or extension
   - Write findings progressively

### Step 6: AGENTS.md Size Check

1. Read AGENTS.md
2. Count characters
3. Calculate percentage of limits
4. Assess status (Within Target / Warning / CRITICAL)
5. Write finding if over target

### Step 7: Rules Governance Validation

**Validate contradictions, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies** across all governance layers:

1. **Read all governance files**:
   - `governance/vision/**/*.md`
   - `governance/principles/**/*.md`
   - `governance/conventions/**/*.md`
   - `governance/development/**/*.md`
   - `governance/workflows/**/*.md`
   - `governance/repository-governance-architecture.md`
   - `governance/README.md`
   - `docs/explanation/README.md`

2. **Contradiction Detection**:
   - Extract key statements from each document
   - Cross-reference related documents (e.g., principle → conventions implementing it)
   - Identify conflicting statements
   - Assess criticality based on impact

3. **Inaccuracy Detection**:
   - Validate all file path references
   - Check agent/skill name references against actual files
   - Verify layer numbering consistency
   - Validate frontmatter requirements match actual usage

4. **Inconsistency Detection**:
   - Check terminology consistency across documents
   - Validate cross-references resolve correctly
   - Verify index files match directory contents
   - Check README summaries align with detailed documents

5. **Traceability Validation**:
   - For each principle: Check "Vision Supported" section exists
   - For each convention: Check "Principles Implemented/Respected" section exists
   - For each development practice: Check both "Principles" AND "Conventions" sections exist
   - For each workflow: Check agent references are correct

6. **Layer Coherence Validation**:
   - Verify vision → principles alignment
   - Verify principles → conventions/development alignment
   - Verify conventions/development → agents alignment
   - Verify agents → workflows alignment

7. **Write findings progressively** using report format above

### Step 8: Software Documentation Validation

**Scope**: `docs/explanation/software-engineering/` (~265 files, ~345k lines)

**Purpose**: Validate comprehensive software design and coding standards documentation as authoritative reference.

#### 8.1 Governance Principle Alignment

**Validate that software documentation correctly references governance principles**:

1. **Extract Principle References**:
   - Read frontmatter `principles:` field from each software doc
   - Identify documents that should cite specific principles:
     - Security docs → explicit-over-implicit, automation-over-manual
     - Architecture docs → simplicity-over-complexity, explicit-over-implicit
     - Development practice docs → automation-over-manual
     - Testing docs → automation-over-manual, reproducibility

2. **Assess Appropriateness**:
   - Check if document topic aligns with cited principles
   - Flag missing critical principle citations
   - Identify inappropriate or irrelevant citations

3. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Broken principle reference (file doesn't exist)
   - **HIGH**: Missing critical principle (security doc without explicit-over-implicit or automation-over-manual)
   - **MEDIUM**: Missing recommended principle (could strengthen doc)
   - **LOW**: Enhancement suggestion only

**Report Format**:

````markdown
### Finding: Governance Principle Alignment

**Category**: Principle Alignment
**File**: docs/explanation/software-engineering/programming-languages/java/ex-soen-prla-ja\_\_security.md
**Criticality**: HIGH

**Issue**: Security documentation missing explicit-over-implicit principle reference

**Evidence**:
Current frontmatter:

```yaml
principles:
  - automation-over-manual
```

Expected: Should include explicit-over-implicit given document focuses on security practices

**Recommendation**: Add explicit-over-implicit to principles frontmatter
````

#### 8.2 Cross-Reference Completeness

**Validate links between software docs and governance documentation**:

1. **Extract Cross-References**:
   - Find all links from software docs to `governance/`
   - Find all links from governance docs to `docs/explanation/software-engineering/`
   - Build bidirectional reference map

2. **Validate Targets**:
   - Check all referenced files exist
   - Verify links use correct GitHub markdown format (`.md` extension)
   - Check for broken anchors (if link includes `#heading`)

3. **Check Bidirectional References**:
   - When software doc references governance, check if governance should reference back
   - Example: If `ex-soen-prla-ja__functional-programming.md` references `governance/development/pattern/functional-programming.md`, the governance doc should list Java in "Language Support" section

4. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Broken link (404, target doesn't exist)
   - **HIGH**: One-way reference when bidirectional expected
   - **MEDIUM**: Missing internal cross-reference within software docs
   - **LOW**: Optional enhancement (could add helpful link)

**Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: Cross-Reference Completeness

**Category**: Cross-Reference
**Files**: docs/explanation/software-engineering/programming-languages/java/ex-soen-prla-ja\_\_functional-programming.md → governance/development/pattern/functional-programming.md
**Criticality**: HIGH

**Issue**: One-way cross-reference (should be bidirectional)

**Evidence**:

- Java doc references governance FP document ✓
- Governance FP document doesn't list Java in language support ✗

**Recommendation**: Add Java to "Language-Specific Implementations" section in governance/development/pattern/functional-programming.md
```

#### 8.3 File Naming Convention Adherence

**Validate software documentation follows established naming patterns**:

1. **Pattern Validation**:
   - **Stack Language**: `ex-soen-prla-[abbrev]__[topic].md`
     - Abbreviations: `ja` (Java), `ty` (TypeScript), `go` (Go), `py` (Python), `ex` (Elixir)
   - **Stack Libraries**: `ex-soen-plwe-[framework-abbrev]__[topic].md`
     - Examples: `jvsp` (JVM Spring Boot), `expr` (Elixir Phoenix), `tsre` (TS React)
   - **Architecture**: `ex-soen-arch-[pattern]__[topic].md`
   - **Development**: `ex-soen-devp-[practice]__[topic].md`
   - **Exception**: `README.md` for index files
   - **Exception**: `templates/` directory files: `ex-soen-prla-[lang]-te__[name].md`

2. **Abbreviation Consistency**:
   - Check all files in same directory use same abbreviation
   - Example: All Java files should use `ja`, not mix `java` and `ja`

3. **Location Validation**:
   - Verify files are in correct directory based on prefix
   - Example: `ex-soen-prla-ja__*` should be in `programming-languages/java/`

4. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **CRITICAL**: File in wrong directory (organizational integrity)
   - **HIGH**: Missing required prefix (breaks convention severely)
   - **MEDIUM**: Inconsistent abbreviation usage
   - **LOW**: Minor variation (e.g., `test-driven-development` vs `tdd`)

**Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: File Naming Convention

**Category**: File Naming
**File**: docs/explanation/software-engineering/programming-languages/java/security-practices.md
**Criticality**: HIGH

**Issue**: Missing required prefix pattern

**Evidence**:
Current: `security-practices.md`
Expected: `ex-soen-prla-ja__security-practices.md`

**Recommendation**: Rename file to follow convention (use `git mv` to preserve history)
```

#### 8.4 Document Structure Pattern Consistency

**Validate that language/framework documentation follows standard structure**:

1. **Core Documents Check**:
   - For each language (Java, TypeScript, Go, Python, Elixir):
     - **Required**: `idioms.md` - Language-specific patterns
     - **Required**: `best-practices.md` - Clean code standards
     - **Required**: `anti-patterns.md` - Common mistakes
     - **Required**: `README.md` - Overview and index
   - For each framework (Spring Boot, Phoenix, React):
     - **Required**: README.md with architecture integration section

2. **Frontmatter Structure**:
   - Validate all docs have required frontmatter fields:
     - `title:` (required)
     - `description:` (required)
     - `category:` (required, should be "software")
     - `subcategory:` (required, e.g., "prog-lang", "platform-web")
     - `tags:` (required, non-empty list)
     - `principles:` (recommended for most docs)
   - Check frontmatter follows YAML syntax

3. **Heading Hierarchy**:
   - Validate single H1 (title)
   - Check proper nesting (H2 → H3, never H2 → H4)
   - Verify headings are descriptive and follow active voice

4. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **CRITICAL**: Missing core document (idioms/best-practices/anti-patterns)
   - **HIGH**: Invalid/missing required frontmatter field
   - **MEDIUM**: Heading hierarchy violation
   - **LOW**: Missing optional frontmatter field

**Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: Document Structure Pattern

**Category**: Structure Pattern
**Language**: Elixir
**Criticality**: CRITICAL

**Issue**: Missing required anti-patterns document

**Evidence**:
Found:

- ex-soen-prla-ex\_\_idioms.md ✓
- ex-soen-prla-ex\_\_best-practices.md ✓
- ex-soen-prla-ex\_\_anti-patterns.md ✗ (missing)

**Recommendation**: Create ex-soen-prla-ex\_\_anti-patterns.md from template
```

#### 8.5 Template Completeness

**Validate template availability for documented patterns**:

1. **Templates Directory Check**:
   - For each language, verify `templates/` subdirectory exists
   - Example: `docs/explanation/software-engineering/programming-languages/java/templates/`

2. **Template Naming Validation**:
   - Pattern: `ex-soen-prla-[lang]-te__[pattern-name].md`
   - Example: `ex-soen-prla-ja-te__spring-boot-rest-controller.md`

3. **Cross-Reference with Documentation**:
   - When documentation describes a pattern, check if template exists
   - Example: If best-practices.md describes "Service Layer Pattern", template should exist

4. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **CRITICAL**: `templates/` directory missing entirely
   - **HIGH**: Core template missing (REST controller, entity, repository)
   - **MEDIUM**: Referenced template missing (mentioned in docs but absent)
   - **LOW**: Enhancement suggestion (could add template for common pattern)

**Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: Template Completeness

**Category**: Templates
**Language**: Java
**Criticality**: HIGH

**Issue**: Core template missing for documented pattern

**Evidence**:

- Documentation references "Repository Pattern" in best-practices.md
- Template `ex-soen-prla-ja-te__jpa-repository.md` not found

**Recommendation**: Create template from similar pattern or copy from existing codebase examples
```

#### 8.6 Diagram Consistency

**Validate Mermaid diagrams follow accessibility standards**:

1. **Extract Mermaid Blocks**:
   - Find all \`\`\`mermaid code blocks
   - Parse diagram type (flowchart, classDiagram, etc.)

2. **Color Palette Validation**:
   - Check for explicit color definitions
   - Verify use of WCAG AA compliant palette:
     - Blue: `#0173B2`
     - Orange: `#DE8F05`
     - Green: `#029E73`
     - Purple: `#CC78BC`
     - Brown: `#CA9161`
   - Flag diagrams using non-standard colors

3. **Accessibility Check**:
   - Verify `classDef` declarations use accessible colors
   - Check for missing alt text descriptions (should have description before or after diagram)

4. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **CRITICAL**: WCAG AA violation (contrast ratio < 4.5:1)
   - **HIGH**: Missing color definitions (using defaults)
   - **MEDIUM**: Using non-standard palette (should use verified colors)
   - **LOW**: Missing alt text description

**Report Format**:

````markdown
### Finding: Diagram Accessibility

**Category**: Diagrams
**File**: docs/explanation/software-engineering/architecture/c4-architecture-model/ex-soen-arch-c4\_\_system-context.md
**Criticality**: HIGH

**Issue**: Mermaid diagram missing explicit color definitions

**Evidence**:
Diagram uses default colors without `classDef` declarations

**Recommendation**: Add WCAG AA color palette definitions:

```mermaid
classDef blueBox fill:#0173B2,stroke:#0173B2,color:#fff
classDef orangeBox fill:#DE8F05,stroke:#DE8F05,color:#fff
```

#### 8.7 README Index Accuracy

**Validate README files accurately list directory contents**:

1. **Extract Listed Files**:
   - Parse README.md in each software subdirectory
   - Extract file listings from structured sections
   - Build expected file set from README

2. **Compare with Actual Contents**:
   - List actual files in directory (exclude README.md, templates/)
   - Find orphaned files (exist but not listed in README)
   - Find ghost references (listed in README but don't exist)

3. **Description Validation**:
   - Check if README descriptions match actual file content
   - Verify file purpose aligns with listed description

4. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **CRITICAL**: README lists non-existent files (broken references)
   - **HIGH**: Files exist but not listed in README (discoverability issue)
   - **MEDIUM**: Description mismatch (listed purpose != actual content)
   - **LOW**: Could be more comprehensive (README could mention more details)

**Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: README Index Accuracy

**Category**: README Index
**File**: docs/explanation/software-engineering/programming-languages/typescript/README.md
**Criticality**: HIGH

**Issue**: Orphaned files not listed in README

**Evidence**:
Files in directory but not in README:
- ex-soen-prla-ty__type-narrowing.md
- ex-soen-prla-ty__advanced-types.md

**Recommendation**: Add missing files to README index with brief descriptions
````

#### 8.8 Version Documentation Consistency

**Validate version-specific documentation coverage**:

1. **Version Pattern Check**:
   - Pattern: `ex-soen-prla-[lang]__release-[version].md`
   - Example: `ex-soen-prla-ja__release-21.md` (Java 21 LTS)

2. **README Mentions Validation**:
   - Check if README mentions version support
   - Verify mentioned versions have corresponding documentation

3. **LTS Coverage**:
   - **Java**: Validate coverage for LTS versions (17, 21, 25)
   - **Python**: Validate coverage for active versions (3.11+)
   - **TypeScript**: Validate coverage for recent major versions
   - **Go**: Validate coverage for supported versions
   - **Elixir**: Validate coverage for recent releases

4. **Criticality Levels**:
   - **CRITICAL**: README mentions version without corresponding doc
   - **HIGH**: Missing LTS version documentation
   - **MEDIUM**: Missing non-LTS but recent version
   - **LOW**: Could document additional versions for completeness

**Report Format**:

```markdown
### Finding: Version Documentation

**Category**: Version Documentation
**Language**: Java
**Criticality**: HIGH

**Issue**: Missing LTS version documentation

**Evidence**:

- README mentions Java 17, 21, 25 support
- Found: ex-soen-prla-ja\_\_release-21.md ✓
- Missing: ex-soen-prla-ja\_\_release-17.md ✗
- Missing: ex-soen-prla-ja\_\_release-25.md ✗

**Recommendation**: Create version documentation for Java 17 and 25 LTS releases
```

#### Performance Optimization

**Strategy for handling ~265 files (~345k lines)**:

1. **Cache Governance Files**:
   - Read principles list once
   - Cache naming convention rules
   - Store principle → topic mappings

2. **Parallel Reads (Where Safe)**:
   - Group files by directory
   - Read multiple files per directory in single operation
   - Use Glob to get directory listings efficiently

3. **Progressive Writing**:
   - Write each finding immediately as discovered
   - No buffering of findings
   - Prevents memory issues with large validation sets

4. **Efficient Pattern Matching**:
   - Use regex for file name validation (fast)
   - Use Grep for cross-reference extraction (faster than reading all files)
   - Only deep-parse files when validation requires it

**Estimated Duration**: ~35-40 seconds for Step 8 (~265 files, 8 validation categories)

#### Summary Format

**After completing all 8 validation categories, add summary**:

```markdown
## Step 8 Summary: Software Documentation Validation

**Files Analyzed**: [actual count from scan]
**Lines Analyzed**: ~345,000 (approximate)

**Findings by Category**:

- Principle Alignment: X findings (C:N, H:N, M:N, L:N)
- Cross-References: X findings (C:N, H:N, M:N, L:N)
- File Naming: X findings (C:N, H:N, M:N, L:N)
- Structure Patterns: X findings (C:N, H:N, M:N, L:N)
- Templates: X findings (C:N, H:N, M:N, L:N)
- Diagrams: X findings (C:N, H:N, M:N, L:N)
- README Indices: X findings (C:N, H:N, M:N, L:N)
- Version Docs: X findings (C:N, H:N, M:N, L:N)

**Total Software Doc Findings**: X (CRITICAL: N, HIGH: N, MEDIUM: N, LOW: N)
```

### Step 9: Finalize Report

Update report status to "Complete", add summary statistics by category:

- Core Repository findings
- Agent-to-Agent duplication findings
- Agent-Skill duplication findings
- Skill consolidation opportunity findings
- Skills coverage gap findings
- AGENTS.md size findings
- Rules governance findings (contradictions, inaccuracies, inconsistencies, traceability, layer coherence)
- Software documentation findings (principle alignment, cross-references, file naming, structure patterns, templates, diagrams, README indices, version docs)

## Important Notes

**Progressive Writing**: All findings MUST be written immediately during Steps 1-7, not buffered.

**Duplication Detection Accuracy**: Focus on high-confidence matches. False positives are acceptable (fixer will re-validate).

**Performance Considerations**:

- Agent-Skill comparison: O(agents × skills) pairwise comparisons
- Agent-to-Agent comparison: O(agents²/2) pairwise comparisons
- Skill-to-Skill comparison: O(skills²/2) pairwise comparisons
- Use efficient text matching (not character-by-character)
- Progressive writing prevents memory issues during long analysis

**Skill Creation Threshold**: Only suggest new Skills for patterns appearing in 3+ agents (reusability justification).

**Skill Consolidation Threshold**: Only suggest merge when benefits clearly outweigh risks (combined <2000 lines, high cohesion, always used together).

**Conservative Approach**: When uncertain about consolidation, recommend KEEP SEPARATE. Forced merges create more problems than fragmentation.
