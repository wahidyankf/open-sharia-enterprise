description: Comprehensive project planning standards for plans/ directory including folder structure (ideas.md, backlog/, in-progress/, done/), naming convention (YYYY-MM-DD__identifier/), file organization (README.md for small plans, multi-file for large), and Gherkin acceptance criteria. Essential for creating structured, executable project plans.

# Creating Project Plans

## Purpose

This Skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating **structured project plans** in the plans/ directory. Plans follow standardized organization, naming conventions, and acceptance criteria patterns for executable, traceable project work.

**When to use this Skill:**

- Creating new project plans
- Organizing backlog items
- Converting ideas to structured plans
- Writing Gherkin acceptance criteria
- Structuring multi-phase projects
- Moving plans through workflow stages

## Plans Folder Structure

```
plans/
├── ideas.md                              # 1-3 line ideas (brainstorming)
├── backlog/                              # Future work
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD__project-name/        # Planned but not started
├── in-progress/                          # Active work
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD__project-name/        # Currently executing
└── done/                                 # Completed work
    └── YYYY-MM-DD__project-name/        # Archived completed plans
```

## Plan Naming Convention

**Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD__project-identifier/`

**Examples**:

- `2025-11-25__user-auth/`
- `2026-01-02__rules-consolidation/`
- `2025-12-10__api-refactor/`

**Rules**:

- Date: Plan creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Separator: Double underscore (`__`)
- Identifier: Lowercase, hyphen-separated, descriptive
- Trailing slash indicates directory

## Single-File vs Multi-File Plans

### Single-File Structure (≤1000 lines)

**For small to medium plans:**

```
plans/in-progress/2025-11-25__simple-feature/
└── README.md                 # All content in one file
```

**README.md contains**:

- Overview (status, goals, git workflow)
- Requirements (objectives, user stories, acceptance criteria)
- Technical Documentation (architecture, design decisions)
- Delivery Plan (implementation steps, validation, completion status)

### Multi-File Structure (>1000 lines)

**For large, complex plans:**

```
plans/in-progress/2025-11-25__complex-feature/
├── README.md                 # Overview only
├── requirements.md           # Goals, user stories, acceptance criteria
├── tech-docs.md              # Architecture, design decisions
└── delivery.md               # Implementation phases, validation
```

**Benefits**: Better organization, easier navigation, reduced file size.

## Gherkin Acceptance Criteria

**All plans must have Gherkin-format acceptance criteria:**

```gherkin
Given [precondition]
When [action]
Then [expected outcome]
And [additional outcome]
```

**Example**:

```gherkin
Given the user is logged out
When they submit valid credentials
Then they are redirected to the dashboard
And their session is created with correct permissions
```

**Best Practices**:

- Use concrete, testable conditions
- Focus on behavior, not implementation
- One scenario per user story
- Make scenarios independent
- Use consistent language

## Git Workflow in Plans

**Trunk Based Development (Default)**:

- Work on `main` branch directly
- Small, frequent commits
- No feature branches (99% of plans)

**Branch-Based (Exceptional)**:

- Only for experiments, compliance, external contributions
- Must justify in Git Workflow section
- Requires explicit user approval

## Plan Lifecycle

### 1. Ideation (ideas.md)

**Format**: One-liner to 3-line description

**Example**:

```markdown
- **Rules Consolidation**: Fix Skills naming to gerund form, add References sections, create 7 new Skills for complete agent coverage
```

### 2. Planning (backlog/)

**Actions**:

- Create folder with date\_\_identifier
- Write requirements and acceptance criteria
- Define technical approach
- Outline delivery phases

**Status**: Not Started

### 3. Execution (in-progress/)

**Actions**:

- Move from backlog/ to in-progress/
- Update status to "In Progress"
- Execute delivery plan sequentially
- Update checklist with progress

**Status**: In Progress

### 4. Completion (done/)

**Actions**:

- Validate all acceptance criteria met
- Update status to "Completed"
- Move from in-progress/ to done/
- Archive for future reference

**Status**: Completed

## Delivery Plan Structure

### Implementation Steps

Use checkbox format:

```markdown
- [ ] Step 1: Description
  - [ ] Substep 1.1
  - [ ] Substep 1.2
- [ ] Step 2: Description
```

**Update after completion**:

```markdown
- [x] Step 1: Description
  - [x] Substep 1.1
  - [x] Substep 1.2
  - **Implementation Notes**: What was done, decisions made
  - **Date**: 2026-01-02
  - **Status**: Completed
  - **Files Changed**: List of modified files
```

### Validation Checklist

After implementation steps, add validation:

```markdown
### Validation Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code meets quality standards
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Acceptance criteria verified
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Missing acceptance criteria

**Wrong**: Plan without Gherkin scenarios
**Right**: Every plan has concrete acceptance criteria

### ❌ Mistake 2: Vague requirements

**Wrong**: "Improve system performance"
**Right**: "Reduce API response time to <200ms for 95th percentile"

### ❌ Mistake 3: No progress tracking

**Wrong**: Never updating delivery checklist
**Right**: Mark items complete with implementation notes

### ❌ Mistake 4: Wrong folder placement

**Wrong**: Active work in backlog/
**Right**: Move to in-progress/ when starting work
