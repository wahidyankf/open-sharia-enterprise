# 🗺️ Development Roadmap

This project is being developed with a **phased approach** to establish strong Sharia-compliance foundations and gradually expand enterprise capabilities:

## 🔬 Phase 0: Setup and Research

Establishing the foundational infrastructure and conducting research to inform architectural decisions. This phase is building the solid foundation for a life-long project—thoughtful groundwork now ensures we can build a trustworthy, secure, and compliant enterprise platform.

**Two parallel tracks running simultaneously:**

**🏗️ Enterprise Platform Track:**

- 🛠️ **Development Tooling & Processes** - Infrastructure (Volta, formatting, git hooks), documentation framework (Diátaxis, Obsidian), AI agents, planning system
- 🏗️ **Architecture & Design** - Monorepo architecture (Nx workspace), core patterns, technology evaluation
- 🤖 **AI Research** - AI/ML applications, LLM integration, intelligent automation, AI-assisted development
- 🔍 **Sharia Compliance Research** - Evaluating global Islamic standards, regional variations, and multi-jurisdiction requirements
- ☁️ **Infrastructure Creation** - Cloud infrastructure, deployment pipelines, CI/CD setup

**🔐 Security & Compliance Infrastructure Track (IN PARALLEL):**

- 🛡️ **Security Operations Tooling** - Building monitoring, incident response, and security testing capabilities from the ground up
- 🎯 **Red Teaming Infrastructure** - Offensive security tools to continuously test and strengthen platform defenses as we build
- 📋 **Compliance Automation** - Automated validation, audit trails, and regulatory reporting tools being developed alongside platform features
- 🔒 **DevSecOps Research** - Information security frameworks, threat modeling, compliance as code, security operations foundations

## 📊 Phase 1: ERP Foundation

Building a solid enterprise foundation with ERP capabilities to support core business operations:

- 💰 **Financial Management** - Accounting & finance, asset management, reporting & analytics with Sharia compliance
- 🔗 **Operations Management** - Supply chain (halal-compliant), inventory control, procurement & vendor management
- 👥 **People & Customer Management** - HR & payroll (Sharia-compliant), sales & CRM, customer relationships
- 🕌 **Execution & Compliance** - Project management, resource allocation, Sharia compliance framework

## 🌍 Phase 2: Enterprise Domain Expansion

Expand across all enterprise domains following established Islamic standards:

**🏦 Financial Services:**

- 💳 Payments and transaction processing (halal-compliant)
- 🏦 Banking services and lending (Sharia-compliant contracts: murabaha, ijarah, etc.)
- 📊 Investment and wealth management (Islamic finance principles)
- 💰 Zakat calculation and distribution systems

**🛍️ Commerce & Trade:**

- 🛒 E-commerce platforms (halal product verification)
- 📦 Supply chain management (halal certification tracking)
- 🤝 B2B marketplaces (Shariah-compliant contracts)
- 🌐 Cross-border trade (Islamic trade finance)

**🤝 Cooperatives & Community:**

- 🏘️ Islamic cooperatives management (musharakah, mudharabah)
- 💝 Community finance and mutual aid (takaful principles)
- 📱 Microfinance and social impact (Shariah-compliant)
- 🎯 Waqf and endowment management

**🌏 Global Compliance Framework:**

- 🕌 International Islamic standards (based on Phase 0 research)
- 🌍 Multi-jurisdiction compliance (various countries and regions)
- 📖 Regional Shariah interpretations and requirements
- ✈️ Cross-border operations and regulatory harmonization

## 🔐 Security & Compliance Infrastructure (Evolving in Parallel)

**These capabilities are being developed ALONGSIDE the enterprise platform from Phase 0 onward—not as future additions, but as parallel infrastructure that grows with the platform:**

- 🛡️ **Security Operations Tooling** - Built-in monitoring and incident response capabilities to protect the enterprise platform and its users
- 🎯 **Red Teaming Infrastructure** - Offensive security tools to continuously test and strengthen platform defenses as we build
- 📋 **Compliance Automation** - Automated validation, audit trails, and regulatory reporting to maintain Sharia and regulatory compliance across the platform
- 🔐 **Enterprise-Grade Security** - Robust security operations built-in from the start, not bolted on later

**Parallel Development Approach:** As we build each platform feature (ERP modules, financial services, commerce, cooperatives), the corresponding security monitoring, compliance validation, and testing tools are developed in tandem. Security and compliance infrastructure evolves with the platform, ensuring they're architected together from day one.

## 💭 Why This Approach?

- 🔬 **Research before building** - Phase 0 establishes foundations through global compliance, security, and AI research before implementation
- 🌍 **Global from the start** - Designed for multi-jurisdiction support and international Islamic standards from day one
- 🏗️ **ERP as foundation** - Enterprise Resource Planning provides core infrastructure for all business operations across domains
- 🕌 **Sharia-compliance from day one** - Built-in compliance architecture following established Islamic standards, not bolt-on features
- 🔐 **Parallel security infrastructure** - Security operations, red teaming tools, and compliance automation are developed ALONGSIDE platform features from Phase 0 onward—not added later, but built together from the start
- 🛡️ **Security by design** - DevSecOps and compliance-as-code integrated from the start, ensuring security and compliance are architectural foundations
- 📈 **Domain expansion over geographic expansion** - Start with ERP core, then expand to finance, commerce, cooperatives globally rather than one region at a time
- ⚖️ **Gradual expansion** - Phased approach reduces complexity while ensuring quality across all enterprise domains
- 🏗️ **Long-term thinking** - Building solid global enterprise foundations now, with security and compliance infrastructure that evolves in parallel with the platform
